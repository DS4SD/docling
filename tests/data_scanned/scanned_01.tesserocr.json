A table is considered to be simple if it does not contain row spans or column spans. Additionally, a table has a strict HTML structure if every row has the same number of columns after taking into account any row or column spans. Therefore a strict HTML structure looks always rectangular. However, HTML is a lenient encoding format, i.e. tables with rows of different sizes might still be regarded as correct due to implicit display rules. These implicit rules leave room for ambiguity, which we want to avoid. As such, we prefer to have \"strict\" tables, i.e. tables where every row has exactly the same length.", "type": "paragraph", "name": "Text"}, {"prov": [{"bbox": [49.231502532958984, 164.21945190429688, 286.8056945800781, 401.8910217285156], "page": 1, "span": [0, 1149]}], "text": "We have developed a technique that tries to derive a missing bounding box out of its neighbors. As a first step, we use the annotation data to generate the most fine-grained grid that covers the table structure. In case of strict HTML tables, all grid squares are associated with some table cell and in the presence of table spans a cell extends across multiple grid squares. When enough bounding boxes are known for a rectangular table, it is possible to compute the geometrical border lines between the grid rows and columns. Eventually this information is used to generate the missing bounding boxes. Additionally, the existence of unused grid squares indicates that the table rows have unequal number of columns and the overall structure is non-strict. The generation of missing bounding boxes for non-strict HTML tables is ambiguous and therefore quite challenging. Thus, we have decided to simply discard those tables. In case of PubTabNet we have computed missing bounding boxes for 48% of the simple and 69% of the complex tables. Regarding FinTabNet, 68% of the simple and 98% of the complex tables require the generation of bounding boxes.", "type": "paragraph", "name": "Text"}, {"prov": [{"bbox": [49.582130432128906, 140.73533630371094, 286.52978515625, 162.6186065673828], "page": 1, "span": [0, 92]}], "text": "Figure 7 illustrates the distribution of the tables across different dimensions per dataset.", "type": "paragraph", "name": "Text"}, {"prov": [{"bbox": [50.194217681884766, 120.06866455078125, 153.73101806640625, 130.51358032226562], "page": 1, "span": [0, 23]}], "text": "1.2.
