<paragraph><location><page_1><loc_14><loc_23><loc_89><loc_46></location>Firstly the viscosity was assuned to be constant when in fact it is redu√ßed by shear stress and increased by pressure. Ihe effect of shear stress on viscosity can be measured (see 8) and a mean value may be assumed . It is impossible, however, to neasure the combined effect of both high shear stress and high pressure although there is reason to believe they may, to some extent, cancel each other out. Ihis problem is discussed more fully later. Fig.</paragraph>
<paragraph><location><page_1><loc_14><loc_6><loc_95><loc_22></location>It was also assuned that the transition from no slip to total takes place instantaneously at the velocity Vc when in practice it is more likely to take place over a small range of velocities. Ihis gives the theoretical graphs a sharp peak where as the effect of the slip taking place over a range of velocity would be to "round-off" this peak. slip</paragraph>
