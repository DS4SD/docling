## Students around the country are noticing La Salle.

## Some of them have questions only you can answer.

Alumni are the most credible source of information for many prospective students and their parents. That's why we're inviting you to become part of the La Salle Explorer Alumni Recruiting Network (L.E.A.R.N.). There are several ways you can share your La Salle experiences with students and parents:

e Represent the university at college nights and receptions in your area.

e Call students who are interested in La Salle.

e Write a letter on company stationery about your work experience and your La Salle education.

Â¢ Visit high schools to discuss your profession and your preparation at La Salle.

If you are interested in helping the university recruit tomorrow's graduates, please call Maryhelen Driscoll, associate director of admissions, at 215/951-1500. Or return the coupon below.

I'd like to play a role in recruiting students to La Salle.
