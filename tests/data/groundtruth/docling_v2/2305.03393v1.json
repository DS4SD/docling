In section 2, we give an overview of the latest developments in table-structure reconstruction. In section 3 we review the current HTML table encoding (popularised by PubTabNet and FinTabNet) and discuss its flaws. Subsequently, we introduce OTSL in section 4, which includes the language definition, syntax rules and error-correction procedures. In section 5, we apply OTSL on the TableFormer architecture, compare it to TableFormer models trained on HTML and ultimately demonstrate the advantages of using OTSL.
