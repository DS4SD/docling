  item-32 at level 1: picture
    item-32 at level 2: caption: Fig. 1 This figure illustrates the research methodology for the bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis concerning migraine and VTE. Assumption I: relevance assumption; Assumption II: independence/exchangeability assumption; Assumption III: exclusion restriction assumption.
  item-34 at level 1: picture
    item-34 at level 2: caption: Fig. 2 This figure explores the correlation between migraine risk and VTE, validating the presence of heterogeneity and pleiotropy. (A) The forest plot displays individual IVs, with each point flanked by lines that depict the 95% confidence interval. The effect of SNPs on the exposure (migraine) is shown along thex-axis, whereas their impact on the outcome (VTE) is presented on they-axis. A fitted line reflects the Mendelian randomization analysis results. (B) A scatter plot visualizes each IV, with the SNP effects on both exposure and outcome similar to that of the forest plot. Again, a fitted line represents the Mendelian randomization results. (C) The funnel plot positions the coefficient βIVfrom the instrumental variable regression on thex-axis to demonstrate the association's strength, while the inverse of its standard error (1/SEIV†) on they-axis indicates the precision of this estimate. (D) A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis is shown on thex-axis, charting the estimated effects from the Mendelian randomization analysis. With each SNP associated with migraine successively excluded, the analysis recalculates the Mendelian randomization effect estimates, culminating with the “all” category that encompasses all considered SNPs. IV, instrumental variable; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphisms; VTE, venous thromboembolism; SE, standard error.†SE is the standard error of β.
  item-36 at level 1: picture
    item-36 at level 2: caption: Fig. 3 (A–D) This figure presents the relationship between VTE risk and migraine, also verifying heterogeneity and pleiotropy through similar graphic representations as detailed forFig. 2, but with the exposure and outcome reversed—SNPs' effect on VTE and outcome on migraine. SNP, single nucleotide polymorphisms; VTE, venous thromboembolism.
