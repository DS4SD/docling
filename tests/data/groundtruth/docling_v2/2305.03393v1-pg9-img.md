order to compute the TED score. Inference timing results for all experiments were obtained from the same machine On single core with AMD EPYC 7763 CPU @2.45 GHz.

## 5.1 Hyper Parameter Optimization

We have chosen the PubIabNet data set to perform HPO, since it includes Ã  highly diverse set of tables. Also we report TED scores separately for simple and complex tables (tables with cell spans) Results are presented in Table. It is evident that with OTSL, our model achieves the same TED score and slightly 2r speed up in the inference runtime over HIML.

## 5.2 Quantitative Results

We picked the model parameter configuration that produced the best prediction trained and evaluated it on three publicly available data sets: Pub TabNet (395k samples) , FinlabNet (1l3k samples) and PubTables-IM (about IM samples) Performance results are presented in Table.@] It is clearly evident that the model trained on OTSL outperforms HTML across the board; keeping high TEDs and mAP scores evell OIl difficult financial tables (FinTabNet) that contain sparse and tables. large

advantage OvCI HTML when applied on & bigger data set like PubTables-IM and achieves significantly improved scores. Finally; OTSL achieves faster inference due to fewer decoding steps which is a result of the reduced sequence representation:
