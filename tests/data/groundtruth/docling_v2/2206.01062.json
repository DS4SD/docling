There are two objectives. The lower magnification objective has a greater depth of field and view. 2. In order to observe the specimen easily use the lower magnification objective first.

To adjust the interpupillary distance rotate the prism caps until both eyes coincide with the image in the eyepiece. FOCUSING 1. Remove the lens protective cover. 2. Place the specimen on the working stage. 3. Focus the specimen with the left eye first while turning the focus knob until the image appears clear and sharp. 4. Rotate the right eyepiece ring until the images in each eyepiece coincide and are sharp and clear. CHANGING THE BULB 1. Disconnect the power cord. 2.

To adjust the eyepiece for viewing with or without eyeglasses and for differences in acuity between the right and left eyes, follow the following steps: a. Observe an image through the left eyepiece and bring a specific point into focus using the focus knob. b. By turning the diopter ring adjustment for the left eyepiece, bring the same point into sharp focus. c.Then bring the same point into focus through the right eyepiece by turning the right diopter ring. d.With more than one viewer, each viewer should note their own diopter ring position for the left and right eyepieces, then before viewing set the diopter ring adjustments to that setting.
