<text><location><page_3><loc_22><loc_50><loc_89><loc_60></location>Most industries are susceptible to fraud, which poses a risk to both businesses and consumers. According to The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association, health care fraud alone causes the nation around $68 billion annually.$^{1}$ This statistic does not include the numerous other industries where fraudulent activities occur daily. In addition, the growing amount of data that enterprises own makes it difficult for them to detect fraud. Businesses can benefit by using an analytical platform to fully integrate their data with artificial intelligence (AI) technology.</text>
<text><location><page_3><loc_22><loc_41><loc_89><loc_48></location>With IBM Cloud Pakfi for Data on IBM Z, enterprises can modernize their data infrastructure, develop, and deploy machine learning (ML) and AI models, and instantiate highly efficient analytics deployment on IBM LinuxONE. Enterprises can create cutting-edge, intelligent, and interactive applications with embedded AI, colocate data with commercial applications, and use AI to make inferences.</text>

<section_header><location><page_11><loc_11><loc_59><loc_41><loc_61></location>Open-source ecosystem</section_header>
<text><location><page_11><loc_22><loc_48><loc_89><loc_56></location>These days, innovation and product development are not limited to closed doors within an organization. In any industry sector, the solutions include a mix of proprietary code addressing the core business solution that is supported or integrated into other software components from open source. In some cases, enterprises business solutions also are built from open-source community offerings. Thus, open-source software becomes an important ingredient in modern-day solution building.</text>
<text><location><page_11><loc_22><loc_34><loc_89><loc_46></location>IBM actively participates in various open-source communities as part of steering boards defining the roadmap of the community, and also in contributing code to make the community a better place for everyone to participate. Red Hat also actively participates in various open-source communities and makes extensive contributions. In open-source communities, although most open-source development happens on x86 / amd64 or the Intel architecture, the same open-source software is used by other architectures, such as IBM Power (ppc64le), IBM Z and IBM LInuxONE (s390x), ARM, and Sparc. So, the availability of an open-source ecosystem on any architecture is key and critical to business.</text>
<text><location><page_11><loc_22><loc_27><loc_88><loc_33></location>On IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE (s390x) architecture, there is a huge open-source support ecosystem that ranges from operating systems such as Linux; application run times; cloud and container services; DevOps and automation; big data; observability; analytics; databases; and storage. The ecosystem on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE is growing.</text>
<text><location><page_11><loc_22><loc_21><loc_88><loc_25></location>IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE include much open-source software in their ecosystem. You can see the growing list of open-source software for IBM Z and LinuxONE at The Growing Ecosystem of Open-Source Software for IBM Z and LinuxONE.</text>
<text><location><page_11><loc_22><loc_14><loc_89><loc_20></location>IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE are available to various communities to include support for s390x builds as part of their community's continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Also, for open-source community developers, infrastructure resources are available on a no-charge basis through the IBM LinuxONE community cloud.</text>
<text><location><page_12><loc_22><loc_82><loc_89><loc_91></location>CP4D includes a mix of open-source and proprietary data and AI runtime databases; open-source run times like Python; open-source data platforms like Anaconda; ML and DL frameworks like Pytorch and Tensorflow; and thousands of reusable Python packages. All of them are available and supported on s390x architecture to provide seamless parity with x86 architecture and a seamless experience for enterprise data scientists, architects, and data and AI solution developers on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE platforms.</text>
<text><location><page_12><loc_22><loc_73><loc_89><loc_81></location>Anaconda is one of the open-source data platforms that provide Python and R based data science ML frameworks; analytics and data visualization tools; and open-source data science tools and libraries like Conda, XGBoost, and SciKit-Learn. Anaconda runs natively on Linux on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE, and on IBM z/OS Container Extensions (zcX) on z/OS. For more information, see Announcing Anaconda for Linux on IBM Z and LinuxONE.</text>
<text><location><page_12><loc_22><loc_63><loc_89><loc_72></location>In addition to strong, open-source ecosystem support for application development on Linux and enterprise operating systems, a new generation of IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE servers (IBM z16™) also have strong platform support, and AI acceleration capabilities that can be leveraged by open-source software to perform better on the server infrastructure. For example, the recently released CP4D 4.6 has Tensorflow and IBM SnapML frameworks that leverage the AI accelerators when running on an IBM z16 server.</text>
<text><location><page_12><loc_22><loc_59><loc_85><loc_62></location>So, to summarize, there is a huge, growing data and AI open source ecosystem that is supported and optimized on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE servers.</text>
<section_header><location><page_12><loc_10><loc_53><loc_31><loc_55></location>Why AI on IBM Z</section_header>

<text><location><page_15><loc_22><loc_80><loc_88><loc_89></location>Laws and regulations in the data and AI space are accelerating, and many countries are proposing strict AI policies. Countries are monitoring adherence of these policies by the enterprises and imposing fines for any violations. Responding to these regulations are challenging global organizations where multiple regulations apply. For enterprises, it is important to adopt AI policies when there is change, and to validate explainable models to protect against discrimination.</text>

<text><location><page_15><loc_22><loc_47><loc_89><loc_51></location>In fact, in a recent survey, these concerns were echoed by real AI adopters when asked what aspects of trust are most important to them. Although explaining how AI decides is the primary concern, all of these concerns are important.</text>
<text><location><page_15><loc_22><loc_38><loc_89><loc_45></location>The key point here is that risk exists throughout the entire AI lifecycle starting with the underlying data and the business justification behind the "why" of the project and continuing into production. Without a formalized process, there is no way to mitigate these risks to unlock the scale that is required to make automated decisions profitable. With these decisions, the business can operate proactively instead of reactively.</text>
<text><location><page_16><loc_22><loc_85><loc_89><loc_91></location>For example, a business can start testing a model before production for fairness metrics. For this task, enterprises need an end-to-end workflow with approvals to mitigate these risks and increase the scale of AI investments, as shown in Figure 8, which presents a typical AI model lifecycle in an enterprise.</text>

<text><location><page_16><loc_22><loc_23><loc_89><loc_36></location>AI governance is a comprehensive framework that uses a set of automated processes, methodologies, and tools to manage an organization's use of AI. Consistent principles guiding the design, development, deployment, and monitoring of models are critical in driving responsible and trustworthy AI. AI governance includes processes that trace and record the origin of data, models (including associated metadata), and pipelines for audits. The details of entry should include the techniques that trained each model, the hyperparameters that were used, and the metrics from testing phases. These details provide increased transparency into the model's behavior throughout the lifecycle, the data that was influential in its development, and the possible risks.</text>

<text><location><page_27><loc_22><loc_40><loc_89><loc_48></location>The goal is to predict in real time whether the transaction being processed might be a fraudulent transaction or not. To achieve this goal, we build an ML model that can do this prediction for the financial institution. Because there would be many transactions being processed at any point by the financial institution, it is important to perform this prediction of fraudulent transactions in near-real time in a few milliseconds.</text>
<text><location><page_27><loc_22><loc_33><loc_89><loc_39></location>One possible solution is to build and train a TensorFlow based DL model that learns from the historical data and predicts the fraudulent transactions. CP4D on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE is a suitable product where this task can be achieved and the model deployed, and coming up with a serving endpoint.</text>

<text><location><page_29><loc_22><loc_83><loc_87><loc_88></location>With this use case, we attempted to demonstrate how to predict, in real time, whether the transaction that is being processed might be a fraudulent transaction or not. By using the method, you have the following advantages:</text>

<text><location><page_29><loc_22><loc_65><loc_89><loc_68></location>In this use case, we describe how an airline can deploy an AI model for inferencing by using IBMfi zSystems.</text>
<text><location><page_29><loc_22><loc_58><loc_89><loc_64></location>Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is the remaining time or cycles that an aircraft engine is likely to operate without any failure. In this case, it is the equivalent of the number of flights remaining for the engine after the last flight. By estimating RUL, the operator can decide on the next maintenance schedule and avoid unplanned downtime.</text>
<text><location><page_29><loc_22><loc_54><loc_86><loc_56></location>Figure 22 provides an overview of the inferencing architecture for the RUL of an aircraft engine when using IBM Z.</text>

<text><location><page_29><loc_22><loc_8><loc_89><loc_19></location>Because we are looking into data-driven model development, the data set of our target is the run-to-failure data of the engine. We are looking into a supervised learning problem, and we use regression techniques to learn from the data. DL techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are our choice because we are looking into a time series data set. TensorFlow or PyTorch frameworks are leveraged to create models. AI governance monitors the data and model drift to maintain the model quality throughout the model's life.</text>
<text><location><page_30><loc_22><loc_78><loc_89><loc_91></location>Open-source data from NASA was used to build the AI model, which then was deployed on CP4D. CP4D enables the data-scientist's journey from modeling to deployment in a seamless process. Data engineers leverage Db2 to host the data set, which includes the training, testing, and validation of a data set. Since data is hosted on Db2, you can expect low latency while retrieving the data and serve data security needs because Db2 is hosted on the IBM Z platform. Data is fetched by the data refinery to do the necessary pre-processing and data imputations. You can use the programming languages Golang or C++ for real-time predictions, depending on customer needs. For more information about this topic, see "Use case 3: Clearing and settlement" on page 25.</text>
<text><location><page_30><loc_22><loc_70><loc_89><loc_76></location>Model building is done on Watson Studio, leveraging the high-performance computing hardware on IBM Z. You can train the model anywhere (on your own hardware or the cloud) and bring the model directly into CP4D, which provides data scientists with the flexibility of implementation choices.</text>
<text><location><page_30><loc_22><loc_65><loc_89><loc_69></location>We used LSTM to build the AI model and used the training data. The model was continuously evaluated to model convergence. The final model is tested with the test data, which is never exposed at the time of training to make sure that the model works.</text>
<text><location><page_30><loc_22><loc_57><loc_89><loc_63></location>This model is deployed on WML on CP4D and runs on IBM Z. If required, the trained model can be converted to the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format before deployment. Based on project requirements, IBM Z supports high-throughput, low latency inference requirements by leveraging an AI accelerator.</text>
<text><location><page_30><loc_22><loc_47><loc_89><loc_56></location>For decision-making about an aircraft engine's life, it is important to be able to explain the model predictions from end to end. This explainability may be global or local. Global explainability enables decision-makers to evaluate the trained model in general from the subject matter expert (SME) point of view. Local explainability enables the operator to validate the reasons behind the present inference and relate it to the past data points, which are an indicative cause of the prediction.</text>
<text><location><page_30><loc_22><loc_40><loc_89><loc_45></location>The AI governance components such as IBM OpenScale on CP4D support explainability and manages the drifts in data and concept. OpenPages and AI FactSheet together can alert the stakeholders about important events through a dashboard and allow course correction at any point.</text>
<text><location><page_30><loc_22><loc_32><loc_89><loc_38></location>Client-side applications can invoke a REST apiserver that handles some preprocessing of an incoming request before initiating the inference pipeline. Efficiencies might be needed in real-time applications, and inference response time can be reduced by adopting low-level programming while components are communicating.</text>

<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_77><loc_89><loc_85></location>Each year, approximately 5 million newborns worldwide are suffering from a neuro-developmental disorder. Due to the lack of early diagnoses and intervention, many infants are disabled and abandoned, especially in countries with limited numbers of pediatricians with extensive experience in neuro-developmental disorders. This situation is a conundrum that plagues many families around the world.</text>
<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_70><loc_89><loc_76></location>Infant motion analysis plays critical importance to understanding and comprehending healthy childhood development. In infants, monitoring their poses provides information about their health that can lead to a better prediction of early developmental risk assessment and diagnosis.</text>
<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_64><loc_87><loc_68></location>Adults use different techniques and methods to express their feelings (like sick, happy, stressed, or hungry), but this case is usually different for infants who cannot express their feelings. Based on the baby movements, AI can predict their expression or health.</text>
<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_54><loc_87><loc_63></location>In this use case, we examine how AI-powered video analytics can assist new parents and hospitals by addressing pose-based real-time body movements of the infants (such as arching back, head banging, kicking legs, rubbing eyes, stretching, and sucking fingers). During the initial months of a baby's life, spontaneous movements might indicate later developmental disorders, such as cerebral palsy, Rett syndrome, and autism spectrum disorders.</text>
<section_header><location><page_32><loc_11><loc_50><loc_31><loc_51></location>Industry challenges</section_header>
<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_42><loc_89><loc_48></location>There are video surveillance systems that are installed for monitoring an infant's movement in many hospitals or homes so that any problem can be witnessed and potentially even stopped before they take place. These systems require much manual work to monitor the real-stream videos and intervene when a problem is detected.</text>
<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_33><loc_89><loc_41></location>There is a certain amount of trust that you must place on the person who monitors a surveillance system to ensure that the job is being done effectively and efficiently, and that the surveillance system is being vigilantly watched. Because of the dependency on these manual efforts, you need something "smart" that monitors constantly the surveillance system and detect problems effectively.</text>
<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_28><loc_89><loc_32></location>AI is shaping the controls of surveillance that can map and track occurrences with self-learning abilities, AI can improve on human operations and analyze video footage in real time to alert the hospitals or parents if any anomalies are identified.</text>
<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_23><loc_89><loc_26></location>Video processing a stream of data from surveillance systems and then performing advance analytics and detecting anomalies quickly is a significant challenge in the industry.</text>

<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_9><loc_89><loc_17></location>AI is the current "market trend evolution" in video analytics and advancing the decision-making capabilities of the human mind. DL-based computer vision AI techniques are being widely adopted by various industries to solve real-time problems. These techniques improve the detection and prediction accuracy without increasing the hardware cost exponentially. For users, AI greatly reduces the workload of the monitoring staff and provides benefits by detecting unusual incidents and solving many video forensic problems.</text>
<text><location><page_33><loc_22><loc_87><loc_88><loc_91></location>CP4D was used to build and deploy the AI-powered video analytics on infant's motion for health prediction use case on IBM Z. IBM Z with AI accelerator enables faster inference for detecting face and body movements and performing angle analytics in real time.</text>

<text><location><page_33><loc_22><loc_35><loc_89><loc_45></location>Live camera feeds or recorded videos of an infant's movement are the inputs for a pose detection model. This video streaming data was stored in IBM Cloudfi Object Storage for image processing. Video data must be transformed into frames so that the infant's body poses can be detected. These post-estimation components of the pipeline predict the location of all 17-person key points with 3 degrees of freedom each (x, y location and visibility) plus two virtual alignment key points. This approach also embraces a compute-intensive heat map prediction of infant body posture.</text>
<text><location><page_33><loc_22><loc_24><loc_88><loc_33></location>When changes in body posture or movement happen, analytics can be performed, and a threshold can be set for the angle of the body and posture movements. An analysis can be performed on movement that is based on that threshold to help to predict an infant's health index in the output video stream by leveraging the IBM z16 on-chip AI acceleration, which provides an execution speed in real time on an edge device, which cannot be achieved by other means.</text>
