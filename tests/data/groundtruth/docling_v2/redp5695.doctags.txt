<text><location><page_3><loc_22><loc_50><loc_89><loc_60></location>Most industries are susceptible to fraud, which poses a risk to both businesses and consumers. According to The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association, health care fraud alone causes the nation around $68 billion annually.$^{1}$ This statistic does not include the numerous other industries where fraudulent activities occur daily. In addition, the growing amount of data that enterprises own makes it difficult for them to detect fraud. Businesses can benefit by using an analytical platform to fully integrate their data with artificial intelligence (AI) technology.</text>
<text><location><page_3><loc_22><loc_41><loc_89><loc_48></location>With IBM Cloud Pakfi for Data on IBM Z, enterprises can modernize their data infrastructure, develop, and deploy machine learning (ML) and AI models, and instantiate highly efficient analytics deployment on IBM LinuxONE. Enterprises can create cutting-edge, intelligent, and interactive applications with embedded AI, colocate data with commercial applications, and use AI to make inferences.</text>

<text><location><page_11><loc_22><loc_64><loc_88><loc_67></location>For more information about the specifics of these capabilities, see Capabilities on Linux on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE.</text>
<section_header><location><page_11><loc_11><loc_59><loc_41><loc_61></location>Open-source ecosystem</section_header>
<text><location><page_11><loc_22><loc_48><loc_89><loc_56></location>These days, innovation and product development are not limited to closed doors within an organization. In any industry sector, the solutions include a mix of proprietary code addressing the core business solution that is supported or integrated into other software components from open source. In some cases, enterprises business solutions also are built from open-source community offerings. Thus, open-source software becomes an important ingredient in modern-day solution building.</text>
<text><location><page_11><loc_22><loc_34><loc_89><loc_46></location>IBM actively participates in various open-source communities as part of steering boards defining the roadmap of the community, and also in contributing code to make the community a better place for everyone to participate. Red Hat also actively participates in various open-source communities and makes extensive contributions. In open-source communities, although most open-source development happens on x86 / amd64 or the Intel architecture, the same open-source software is used by other architectures, such as IBM Power (ppc64le), IBM Z and IBM LInuxONE (s390x), ARM, and Sparc. So, the availability of an open-source ecosystem on any architecture is key and critical to business.</text>
<text><location><page_11><loc_22><loc_27><loc_88><loc_33></location>On IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE (s390x) architecture, there is a huge open-source support ecosystem that ranges from operating systems such as Linux; application run times; cloud and container services; DevOps and automation; big data; observability; analytics; databases; and storage. The ecosystem on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE is growing.</text>
<text><location><page_11><loc_22><loc_21><loc_88><loc_25></location>IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE include much open-source software in their ecosystem. You can see the growing list of open-source software for IBM Z and LinuxONE at The Growing Ecosystem of Open-Source Software for IBM Z and LinuxONE.</text>
<text><location><page_11><loc_22><loc_14><loc_89><loc_20></location>IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE are available to various communities to include support for s390x builds as part of their community's continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Also, for open-source community developers, infrastructure resources are available on a no-charge basis through the IBM LinuxONE community cloud.</text>
<text><location><page_12><loc_22><loc_82><loc_89><loc_91></location>CP4D includes a mix of open-source and proprietary data and AI runtime databases; open-source run times like Python; open-source data platforms like Anaconda; ML and DL frameworks like Pytorch and Tensorflow; and thousands of reusable Python packages. All of them are available and supported on s390x architecture to provide seamless parity with x86 architecture and a seamless experience for enterprise data scientists, architects, and data and AI solution developers on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE platforms.</text>
<text><location><page_12><loc_22><loc_73><loc_89><loc_81></location>Anaconda is one of the open-source data platforms that provide Python and R based data science ML frameworks; analytics and data visualization tools; and open-source data science tools and libraries like Conda, XGBoost, and SciKit-Learn. Anaconda runs natively on Linux on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE, and on IBM z/OS Container Extensions (zcX) on z/OS. For more information, see Announcing Anaconda for Linux on IBM Z and LinuxONE.</text>
<text><location><page_12><loc_22><loc_63><loc_89><loc_72></location>In addition to strong, open-source ecosystem support for application development on Linux and enterprise operating systems, a new generation of IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE servers (IBM z16™) also have strong platform support, and AI acceleration capabilities that can be leveraged by open-source software to perform better on the server infrastructure. For example, the recently released CP4D 4.6 has Tensorflow and IBM SnapML frameworks that leverage the AI accelerators when running on an IBM z16 server.</text>
<text><location><page_12><loc_22><loc_59><loc_85><loc_62></location>So, to summarize, there is a huge, growing data and AI open source ecosystem that is supported and optimized on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE servers.</text>
<section_header><location><page_12><loc_10><loc_53><loc_31><loc_55></location>Why AI on IBM Z</section_header>
<text><location><page_12><loc_22><loc_42><loc_89><loc_51></location>Data and AI playing a major role in the modernization story to enable the digital transformation journey of every organization. Many organizations recognize the business value of infusing AI into their infrastructure. CP4D provides the cloud-native solution to put your data to work. With CP4D, all your data users can collaborate from a single, unified interface that supports many services that work together, including collecting data, organizing the data, analyzing the data, and infusing AI.</text>
<text><location><page_12><loc_22><loc_30><loc_89><loc_41></location>Traditional ML models' power most of today's ML applications in business and among AI practitioners. CP4D supports traditional ML frameworks for training and inferencing, such as Scikit-learn, Snap ML, and XGBoost. Snap ML is a library that provides high-speed training and inferencing of ML models that leverage the AI accelerator while running on an IBM z16 (Linux on IBM Z). CP4D supports DL frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. TensorFlow is a DL framework that leverages the AI accelerator while running on an IBM z16 (Linux on IBM Z).</text>
<text><location><page_12><loc_22><loc_23><loc_89><loc_29></location>Figure 7 on page 11 provides an overview of the components that are supported on CP4D on IBM Z. You can leverage Watson Studio for model building, training, and validation, and WML for deployment of the model. Eventually, applications can use the AI inference endpoint to score the model.</text>

<text><location><page_13><loc_22><loc_51><loc_81><loc_53></location>In summary, here are some of the reasons why you should choose AI on IBM Z:</text>
<section_header><location><page_13><loc_11><loc_27><loc_26><loc_29></location>AI use cases</section_header>
<text><location><page_13><loc_22><loc_21><loc_87><loc_25></location>With billions of transactions per day in many of today's industries, it is key to get real-time insights about what is happening in your data. AI on the IBM Z stack understands these situations, and it delivers in-transaction inference in real time and at scale.</text>
<text><location><page_13><loc_22><loc_13><loc_89><loc_19></location>Core banking solutions running on IBM Z that are involved in processing inbound transactions need real-time fraud detection to prevent fraud. Other types of possible use cases might be credit risk analysis, anti-money laundering, loan approval, fraud detection in payments, and instant payments.</text>
<text><location><page_13><loc_22><loc_9><loc_89><loc_12></location>For insurance companies, a pressing use case would be claims processing. For markets and trading, clearing and settlement use cases are paramount.</text>
<text><location><page_14><loc_22><loc_87><loc_86><loc_91></location>For the health care industry, medical image processing (such as MRIs and x-rays), skin cancer detection, and patient monitoring activities such as infant motion analysis, is important.</text>
<text><location><page_14><loc_22><loc_81><loc_89><loc_85></location>For the airline industry, processes such as air traffic management, flight management systems, and flight maintenance predictions are use cases that are ideal candidates for using AI on IBM Z.</text>
<text><location><page_14><loc_22><loc_78><loc_68><loc_79></location>In the following sections, we describe the following use cases:</text>
<section_header><location><page_14><loc_11><loc_35><loc_89><loc_40></location>Use case 1: Responsible AI augmented with risk and regulatory compliance</section_header>
<text><location><page_14><loc_22><loc_27><loc_89><loc_33></location>Advancement in AI is changing the world, and organizations must adopt AI to embrace new challenges daily. Many enterprises see tremendous value in adopting AI and ML technologies while establishing organization trust in the models, underlying data, and the process to be followed. An AI model lifecycle can be a daunting task.</text>
<text><location><page_14><loc_22><loc_23><loc_89><loc_26></location>How mature is your AI governance? In this section, we provide a use case demonstrating the trustworthiness of AI and its importance in daily monitoring.</text>
<section_header><location><page_14><loc_11><loc_19><loc_31><loc_21></location>Industry challenges</section_header>
<text><location><page_14><loc_22><loc_16><loc_83><loc_17></location>Here are the three main reasons why organizations struggle with the adoption of AI:</text>
<section_header><location><page_15><loc_22><loc_90><loc_53><loc_91></location>Scaling with growing regulations</section_header>
<text><location><page_15><loc_22><loc_80><loc_88><loc_89></location>Laws and regulations in the data and AI space are accelerating, and many countries are proposing strict AI policies. Countries are monitoring adherence of these policies by the enterprises and imposing fines for any violations. Responding to these regulations are challenging global organizations where multiple regulations apply. For enterprises, it is important to adopt AI policies when there is change, and to validate explainable models to protect against discrimination.</text>
<section_header><location><page_15><loc_22><loc_77><loc_37><loc_78></location>Responsible AI</section_header>
<text><location><page_15><loc_22><loc_71><loc_89><loc_76></location>Responsible AI protects against loss of data privacy, and reduced customer loyalty and trust. A data scientist cannot maximize accuracy and model performance above all other concerns. Practicing responsible AI is a best practice, and you must establish protection and validation to ensure that any models that are placed into production are fair and explainable.</text>
<section_header><location><page_15><loc_22><loc_67><loc_59><loc_69></location>Risks throughout the entire AI workflow</section_header>
<text><location><page_15><loc_22><loc_65><loc_64><loc_67></location>Organizations need to mitigate risk of the following items:</text>
<text><location><page_15><loc_22><loc_47><loc_89><loc_51></location>In fact, in a recent survey, these concerns were echoed by real AI adopters when asked what aspects of trust are most important to them. Although explaining how AI decides is the primary concern, all of these concerns are important.</text>
<text><location><page_15><loc_22><loc_38><loc_89><loc_45></location>The key point here is that risk exists throughout the entire AI lifecycle starting with the underlying data and the business justification behind the "why" of the project and continuing into production. Without a formalized process, there is no way to mitigate these risks to unlock the scale that is required to make automated decisions profitable. With these decisions, the business can operate proactively instead of reactively.</text>
<text><location><page_16><loc_22><loc_85><loc_89><loc_91></location>For example, a business can start testing a model before production for fairness metrics. For this task, enterprises need an end-to-end workflow with approvals to mitigate these risks and increase the scale of AI investments, as shown in Figure 8, which presents a typical AI model lifecycle in an enterprise.</text>
<caption><location><page_17><loc_22><loc_90><loc_41><loc_91></location>Figure 8 Typical AI</caption>
<text><location><page_16><loc_22><loc_46><loc_88><loc_55></location>Due to regulations, more stakeholders adopt the typical AI model lifecycle to protect their brand from new end-to-end risks. To ensure various aspects of both regulatory compliance and security, the personas that must be involved include the chief financial officer (CFO), chief marketing officer (CMO), chief data officer (CDO), HR, and chief regulatory officer (CRO), along with the data engineers, data scientists, and business analysts, who build AI workflows.</text>

<text><location><page_16><loc_22><loc_38><loc_88><loc_41></location>AI model lifecycle governance, risk management, and regulatory compliance are key to the success of enterprises.</text>
<text><location><page_16><loc_22><loc_23><loc_89><loc_36></location>AI governance is a comprehensive framework that uses a set of automated processes, methodologies, and tools to manage an organization's use of AI. Consistent principles guiding the design, development, deployment, and monitoring of models are critical in driving responsible and trustworthy AI. AI governance includes processes that trace and record the origin of data, models (including associated metadata), and pipelines for audits. The details of entry should include the techniques that trained each model, the hyperparameters that were used, and the metrics from testing phases. These details provide increased transparency into the model's behavior throughout the lifecycle, the data that was influential in its development, and the possible risks.</text>
<text><location><page_16><loc_22><loc_16><loc_89><loc_21></location>In a world where trust, transparency and explainable AI matters, every organization wants compliance along with the comfort of understanding how analytic insights and decisions are made. The following sections describe some of the principles and organizational requirements for AI governance.</text>

<text><location><page_17><loc_22><loc_54><loc_89><loc_60></location>Regulatory compliance is a set of rules that organizations must follow to protect sensitive information and ensure human safety. Any business that works with digital assets, consumer data, health regulations, employee safety, and private communications is subject to regulatory compliance.$^{3}$ The IBM AI governance solution for IBM Z includes the following tasks:</text>
<text><location><page_17><loc_22><loc_40><loc_89><loc_46></location>Enterprises can develop AI models and deploy them by using IBM Watson Studio or WML on CP4D on Red Hat OpenShift on a virtual machine that is based on IBM z/VM or Red Hat Enterprise Linux KVM on IBM Z. AI governance on IBM LinuxONE is supported in the following two ways:</text>

<text><location><page_24><loc_22><loc_71><loc_89><loc_77></location>Financial institutions must make an accurate decision about whether to sanction a loan or not, and judging the likelihood of default is the difference between a successful and unsuccessful loan portfolio. In a traditional scenario, an experienced banker can judge someone's likelihood of default, but that is not an efficient method for judgment as a business grows.</text>

<text><location><page_24><loc_22><loc_55><loc_89><loc_65></location>In the modern world, growing business institutions can no longer rely on only experienced bankers to decide whether to sanction a loan knowing that there is a probability that the borrower might default on their loans. A better choice is to rely on technological advancements that can help with reasoning based on facts, such as leveraging credit risk modeling techniques to process the historical data of past borrowers to understand their credit behavior and make a more informed decision about whether to lend money, how much money, and decide on the tenure to close the loan.</text>
<text><location><page_24><loc_22><loc_49><loc_89><loc_53></location>Financial institutions can leverage AI solutions by using ML techniques to predict the credit risk. Applying AI to credit risk modeling techniques can benefit institutions in decision-making, and thus can help better manage the exposure to credit risk.</text>
<text><location><page_24><loc_22><loc_42><loc_89><loc_48></location>Figure 19 on page 23 shows a sample architecture about how to design and develop an AI model for credit risk assessment on IBM Z. An IBM WebSpherefi Application Server is used for handling in-bound transactions, and CP4D is used for AI model lifecycle management that includes building, training, and deploying the model.</text>

<text><location><page_25><loc_22><loc_39><loc_89><loc_47></location>Then, the banking loan approval team can send a loan applicant request to the IBM WebSphere Application Server, which can make a request to the AI inference endpoint. The AI inference engine scores the transaction and sends the result back to the loan approval team. Based on the results, the approval team can decide on whether to approve a loan or not, and also decide how much they can lend, timelines, and other factors.</text>
<text><location><page_25><loc_22><loc_33><loc_86><loc_38></location>The transaction system that is shown in Figure 19 uses IBM WebSphere Liberty as an application server, but you also can use an IBM Open Libertyfi application server or any application server that can send RESTful API communications.</text>
<text><location><page_25><loc_22><loc_23><loc_89><loc_32></location>Models are frequently developed and tested in many platforms and languages, such as Python, Scala, R, and Go. Models can leverage ML frameworks like scikit-learn, Snap ML, or XGBoost, or DL frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Training a model can be done on any platform if you have enough computing power for complex models, but moving that model into production requires careful testing to ensure that transactions are not delayed, especially if you plan to run the model within a transaction.</text>
<text><location><page_25><loc_22><loc_19><loc_89><loc_22></location>We showed how IBM Z enable customers to use AI frameworks to detect credit risk. Now, we look at how you can leverage CP4D and TensorFlow on IBM Z to detect the credit risk.</text>
<text><location><page_26><loc_22><loc_90><loc_80><loc_91></location>Figure 20 shows an architecture for predicting credit risk by using DL on IBM Z.</text>
<caption><location><page_27><loc_22><loc_33><loc_89><loc_39></location>Figure 20 Architecture for credit risk prediction by using DL on IBM Z</caption>
<text><location><page_26><loc_22><loc_46><loc_87><loc_52></location>Data scientists can start creating and training a DL AI model by using a Jupyter Notebook instance and Watson Studio. Then, they can deploy the model by using WML on CP4D running on IBM Z, which provides an endpoint. Other applications, including the IBM WebSphere server, can produce credit risk results by using the model's endpoint.</text>
<text><location><page_26><loc_22><loc_42><loc_89><loc_44></location>In summary, here are some considerations for developing real-time AI models, such as credit risk assessment:</text>
<section_header><location><page_27><loc_11><loc_89><loc_55><loc_91></location>Use case 3: Clearing and settlement</section_header>
<text><location><page_27><loc_22><loc_80><loc_88><loc_87></location>Clearing and settlements involve banks or financial institutions sending and receiving wire transfers by using secure interbank payments networks that can clear or settle numerous transactions. When an individual or business entity initiates a wire transfer, clearing begins the fund delivery process. Banks can begin the settlement phase either immediately after clearing takes place or later, mostly at the end of the business day.</text>
<section_header><location><page_27><loc_11><loc_76><loc_29><loc_77></location>Industry challenge</section_header>
<text><location><page_27><loc_22><loc_71><loc_88><loc_74></location>Banks and financial institutions must deal with high-risk transactions that can lead to loss. Moreover, these transactions can lead to regulatory violations and extra compliance costs.</text>
<section_header><location><page_27><loc_11><loc_67><loc_43><loc_69></location>Clearing and settlement solution</section_header>
<text><location><page_27><loc_22><loc_59><loc_89><loc_65></location>Use AI to predict which trades or transactions have high risk exposures, and propose solutions for a more efficient settlement process. The expedited remediation of questionable transactions can prevent costly consequences, regulatory violations, and negative business impacts.</text>
<text><location><page_27><loc_22><loc_49><loc_89><loc_58></location>In financial institutions, finding which financial transactions are legitimate and which transactions are fraudulent is of paramount importance. In this section, we go through a use case where we use AI to predict which trades or transactions have high risk exposures, and propose solutions for a more efficient settlement process. The expedited remediation of questionable transactions can prevent costly consequences, regulatory violations, and negative business impacts to financial institutions.</text>
<text><location><page_27><loc_22><loc_40><loc_89><loc_48></location>The goal is to predict in real time whether the transaction being processed might be a fraudulent transaction or not. To achieve this goal, we build an ML model that can do this prediction for the financial institution. Because there would be many transactions being processed at any point by the financial institution, it is important to perform this prediction of fraudulent transactions in near-real time in a few milliseconds.</text>
<text><location><page_28><loc_22><loc_88><loc_88><loc_91></location>Figure 21 provides a high-level diagram of a clearing and settlement use case for financial transactions that uses CP4D on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE.</text>

<section_header><location><page_29><loc_11><loc_89><loc_20><loc_91></location>Summary</section_header>
<text><location><page_29><loc_22><loc_83><loc_87><loc_88></location>With this use case, we attempted to demonstrate how to predict, in real time, whether the transaction that is being processed might be a fraudulent transaction or not. By using the method, you have the following advantages:</text>
<section_header><location><page_29><loc_11><loc_70><loc_79><loc_72></location>Use case 4: Remaining Useful Life of an aircraft engine</section_header>
<text><location><page_29><loc_22><loc_65><loc_89><loc_68></location>In this use case, we describe how an airline can deploy an AI model for inferencing by using IBMfi zSystems.</text>
<text><location><page_29><loc_22><loc_58><loc_89><loc_64></location>Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is the remaining time or cycles that an aircraft engine is likely to operate without any failure. In this case, it is the equivalent of the number of flights remaining for the engine after the last flight. By estimating RUL, the operator can decide on the next maintenance schedule and avoid unplanned downtime.</text>
<text><location><page_29><loc_22><loc_54><loc_86><loc_56></location>Figure 22 provides an overview of the inferencing architecture for the RUL of an aircraft engine when using IBM Z.</text>
<caption><location><page_31><loc_22><loc_28><loc_87><loc_30></location>Figure 22 Inferencing architecture on IBM Z</caption>
<text><location><page_29><loc_22><loc_8><loc_89><loc_19></location>Because we are looking into data-driven model development, the data set of our target is the run-to-failure data of the engine. We are looking into a supervised learning problem, and we use regression techniques to learn from the data. DL techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are our choice because we are looking into a time series data set. TensorFlow or PyTorch frameworks are leveraged to create models. AI governance monitors the data and model drift to maintain the model quality throughout the model's life.</text>
<text><location><page_30><loc_22><loc_78><loc_89><loc_91></location>Open-source data from NASA was used to build the AI model, which then was deployed on CP4D. CP4D enables the data-scientist's journey from modeling to deployment in a seamless process. Data engineers leverage Db2 to host the data set, which includes the training, testing, and validation of a data set. Since data is hosted on Db2, you can expect low latency while retrieving the data and serve data security needs because Db2 is hosted on the IBM Z platform. Data is fetched by the data refinery to do the necessary pre-processing and data imputations. You can use the programming languages Golang or C++ for real-time predictions, depending on customer needs. For more information about this topic, see "Use case 3: Clearing and settlement" on page 25.</text>
<text><location><page_30><loc_22><loc_70><loc_89><loc_76></location>Model building is done on Watson Studio, leveraging the high-performance computing hardware on IBM Z. You can train the model anywhere (on your own hardware or the cloud) and bring the model directly into CP4D, which provides data scientists with the flexibility of implementation choices.</text>
<text><location><page_30><loc_22><loc_65><loc_89><loc_69></location>We used LSTM to build the AI model and used the training data. The model was continuously evaluated to model convergence. The final model is tested with the test data, which is never exposed at the time of training to make sure that the model works.</text>
<text><location><page_30><loc_22><loc_57><loc_89><loc_63></location>This model is deployed on WML on CP4D and runs on IBM Z. If required, the trained model can be converted to the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format before deployment. Based on project requirements, IBM Z supports high-throughput, low latency inference requirements by leveraging an AI accelerator.</text>
<text><location><page_30><loc_22><loc_47><loc_89><loc_56></location>For decision-making about an aircraft engine's life, it is important to be able to explain the model predictions from end to end. This explainability may be global or local. Global explainability enables decision-makers to evaluate the trained model in general from the subject matter expert (SME) point of view. Local explainability enables the operator to validate the reasons behind the present inference and relate it to the past data points, which are an indicative cause of the prediction.</text>
<text><location><page_30><loc_22><loc_40><loc_89><loc_45></location>The AI governance components such as IBM OpenScale on CP4D support explainability and manages the drifts in data and concept. OpenPages and AI FactSheet together can alert the stakeholders about important events through a dashboard and allow course correction at any point.</text>
<text><location><page_30><loc_22><loc_32><loc_89><loc_38></location>Client-side applications can invoke a REST apiserver that handles some preprocessing of an incoming request before initiating the inference pipeline. Efficiencies might be needed in real-time applications, and inference response time can be reduced by adopting low-level programming while components are communicating.</text>

<text><location><page_31><loc_22><loc_39><loc_82><loc_41></location>In summary, consider the following points while developing an AI-based predictive maintenance application:</text>
<section_header><location><page_32><loc_11><loc_87><loc_89><loc_91></location>Use case 5: AI-powered video analytics on an infant's motions for health prediction</section_header>
<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_77><loc_89><loc_85></location>Each year, approximately 5 million newborns worldwide are suffering from a neuro-developmental disorder. Due to the lack of early diagnoses and intervention, many infants are disabled and abandoned, especially in countries with limited numbers of pediatricians with extensive experience in neuro-developmental disorders. This situation is a conundrum that plagues many families around the world.</text>
<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_70><loc_89><loc_76></location>Infant motion analysis plays critical importance to understanding and comprehending healthy childhood development. In infants, monitoring their poses provides information about their health that can lead to a better prediction of early developmental risk assessment and diagnosis.</text>
<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_64><loc_87><loc_68></location>Adults use different techniques and methods to express their feelings (like sick, happy, stressed, or hungry), but this case is usually different for infants who cannot express their feelings. Based on the baby movements, AI can predict their expression or health.</text>
<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_54><loc_87><loc_63></location>In this use case, we examine how AI-powered video analytics can assist new parents and hospitals by addressing pose-based real-time body movements of the infants (such as arching back, head banging, kicking legs, rubbing eyes, stretching, and sucking fingers). During the initial months of a baby's life, spontaneous movements might indicate later developmental disorders, such as cerebral palsy, Rett syndrome, and autism spectrum disorders.</text>
<section_header><location><page_32><loc_11><loc_50><loc_31><loc_51></location>Industry challenges</section_header>
<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_42><loc_89><loc_48></location>There are video surveillance systems that are installed for monitoring an infant's movement in many hospitals or homes so that any problem can be witnessed and potentially even stopped before they take place. These systems require much manual work to monitor the real-stream videos and intervene when a problem is detected.</text>
<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_33><loc_89><loc_41></location>There is a certain amount of trust that you must place on the person who monitors a surveillance system to ensure that the job is being done effectively and efficiently, and that the surveillance system is being vigilantly watched. Because of the dependency on these manual efforts, you need something "smart" that monitors constantly the surveillance system and detect problems effectively.</text>
<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_28><loc_89><loc_32></location>AI is shaping the controls of surveillance that can map and track occurrences with self-learning abilities, AI can improve on human operations and analyze video footage in real time to alert the hospitals or parents if any anomalies are identified.</text>
<text><location><page_32><loc_22><loc_23><loc_89><loc_26></location>Video processing a stream of data from surveillance systems and then performing advance analytics and detecting anomalies quickly is a significant challenge in the industry.</text>

<text><location><page_33><loc_22><loc_87><loc_88><loc_91></location>CP4D was used to build and deploy the AI-powered video analytics on infant's motion for health prediction use case on IBM Z. IBM Z with AI accelerator enables faster inference for detecting face and body movements and performing angle analytics in real time.</text>
<text><location><page_33><loc_22><loc_79><loc_89><loc_85></location>Figure 24 shows an architectural diagram about how to design and develop an AI model for real-time body pose detection on IBM Z. A deep convolutional neural network architecture was trained on the task of infant pose estimation on the custom data set by leveraging IBM Cloud Pak for Data.</text>
<caption><location><page_34><loc_10><loc_28><loc_19><loc_30></location>Figure</caption>
<text><location><page_33><loc_22><loc_35><loc_89><loc_45></location>Live camera feeds or recorded videos of an infant's movement are the inputs for a pose detection model. This video streaming data was stored in IBM Cloudfi Object Storage for image processing. Video data must be transformed into frames so that the infant's body poses can be detected. These post-estimation components of the pipeline predict the location of all 17-person key points with 3 degrees of freedom each (x, y location and visibility) plus two virtual alignment key points. This approach also embraces a compute-intensive heat map prediction of infant body posture.</text>
<text><location><page_33><loc_22><loc_24><loc_88><loc_33></location>When changes in body posture or movement happen, analytics can be performed, and a threshold can be set for the angle of the body and posture movements. An analysis can be performed on movement that is based on that threshold to help to predict an infant's health index in the output video stream by leveraging the IBM z16 on-chip AI acceleration, which provides an execution speed in real time on an edge device, which cannot be achieved by other means.</text>
<text><location><page_33><loc_22><loc_22><loc_72><loc_23></location>We can leverage the following AI technology stack for this use case:</text>
<text><location><page_34><loc_22><loc_87><loc_89><loc_91></location>WML was used for deployment of the pose detection model and generated notifications to users with web and mobile applications, and it integrates with Fitbit for push notifications so that hospitals and parents can take preventive actions.</text>
