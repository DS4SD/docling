This is a word document and this is an inline equation: $A= \pi r^{2} $. If instead, I want an equation by line, I can do this:

$a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2} \text{ \texttimes } 23$

And that is an equation by itself. Cheers!

This is another equation:

$f\left(x\right)=a\_{0}+\sum\_{n=1}^{ \infty }\left(a\_{n}\cos(\frac{n \pi x}{L})+b\_{n}\sin(\frac{n \pi x}{L})\right)$

This is a word document and this is an inline equation: $A= \pi r^{2} $. If instead, I want an equation by line, I can do this:

$\left(x+a\right)^{n}=\sum\_{k=0}^{n}\left(\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{n}{k}\right)x^{k}a^{n-k}$

And that is an equation by itself. Cheers!

This is another equation:

$\left(1+x\right)^{n}=1+\frac{nx}{1!}+\frac{n\left(n-1\right)x^{2}}{2!}+ \text{ \textellipsis } $

This is a word document and this is an inline equation: $A= \pi r^{2} $. If instead, I want an equation by line, I can do this:

$e^{x}=1+\frac{x}{1!}+\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+ \text{ \textellipsis } , - \infty  < x <  \infty $

And that is an equation by itself. Cheers!
