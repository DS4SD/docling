    item-69 at level 2: caption: Figure 1. Diagrams of APs and F-COPI. (A) Structures of the assembled complexes. All six complexes are heterotetramers; the individual subunits are called adaptins in the APs (e.g., γ-adaptin) and COPs in COPI (e.g., γ-COP). The two large subunits in each complex are structurally similar to each other. They are arranged with their N-terminal domains in the core of the complex, and these domains are usually (but not always) followed by a flexible linker and an appendage domain. The medium subunits consist of an N-terminal longin-related domain followed by a C-terminal μ homology domain (MHD). The small subunits consist of a longin-related domain only. (B) Jpred secondary structure predictions of some of the known subunits (all from Homo sapiens), together with new family members from Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd) and Arabidopsis thaliana (At).

    item-77 at level 2: caption: Figure 1—figure supplement 4. TSET orthologues in different species. The orthologues were identified by reverse HHpred, except for those in italics, which were found by BLAST searching (NCBI) using closely related organisms. TTRAY1 and TTRAY2 were initially identified by proteomics in a complex with TSET, but could also have been predicted by reverse HHpred as closely related to β′-COP using the PDB structure, 3mkq_A. In all other organisms TTRAY1 and TTRAY2 were identified by NCBI BLAST (italics). Note that orthologues of TSAUCER in P. patens, and TTRAY 2 in M. pusilla were identified in Phytozome, which is a genomic database hosted by Joint Genome Institute (JGI). Note orthologues of TCUP in D. purpureum and TSPOON in D. discoideum were identified by searching genomic sequences using closely related sequences, and have been manually appended in DictyBase. In these cases corresponding sequences are not at present found at NCBI. Whilst S. moellendorffii and V. vinifera were included in the reverse HHpred database, they were not included in the Coulson plot. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02866.009

The identity of the hits was determined using NCBI BLAST searching. Note that all of the organisms that have lost AP-4 have also lost its binding partner, tepsin.

(A) Western blots of axenic D. discoideum expressing either GFP-tagged small subunit (σ-like) or free GFP, under the control of the Actin15 promoter, labelled with anti-GFP. The Ax2 parental cell strain was included as a control, and an antibody against the AP-2α subunit was used to demonstrate that equivalent amounts of protein were loaded. (B) Coomassie blue-stained gel of GFP-tagged small subunit and associated proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP. The GFP-tagged protein is indicated with a red asterix. (C) iBAQ ratios (an estimate of molar ratios) for the proteins that consistently coprecipitated with the GFP-tagged small subunit. All appear to be equimolar with each other, and the higher ratios for the small (σ-like/TSPOON) subunit and GFP are likely to be a consequence of their overexpression, which we also saw in a repeat experiment in which we used the small subunit's own promoter (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). (D) Predicted structure of the N-terminal portion of D. discoideum TTRAY1, shown as a ribbon diagram. (E) Stills from live cell imaging of cells expressing either TSPOON-GFP or free GFP, using TIRF microscopy. The punctate labelling in the TSPOON-GFP-expressing cells indicates that some of the construct is associated with the plasma membrane. See Videos 1 and 2. (F) Western blots of extracts from cells expressing either TSPOON-GFP or free GFP. The post-nuclear supernatants (PNS) were centrifuged at high speed to generate supernatant (cytosol) and pellet fractions. Equal protein loadings were probed with anti-GFP. Whereas the GFP was exclusively cytosolic, a substantial proportion of TSPOON-GFP fractionated into the membrane-containing pellet. (G) Mean generation time (MGT) for control (Ax2) and TSPOON knockout cells. The knockout cells grew slightly faster than the control. (H) Differentiation of the Ax2 control strain and two TSPOON knockout strains (1725 and 1727). All three strains produced fruiting bodies upon starvation. (I) Assay for fluid phase endocytosis. The control and knockout strains took up FITC-dextran at similar rates. (J) Assay for endocytosis of membrane, labelled with FM1-43, showing the time taken to internalise the entire surface area. The knockout strains took significantly longer than the control (*p<0.05; **p<0.01). See also Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2, Figure 2; Videos 1 and 2.

(B) Fluorescence and phase contrast micrographs of cells expressing GFP-tagged TSPOON under the control of its own promoter (Prom-TSPOON-GFP). The construct appears mainly cytosolic. (C) Homology modeling of TTRAYs from A. thaliana, D. discoideum, and N. gruberi, revealing two β-propeller domains followed by an α-solenoid. (D) Disruption of the TSPOON gene. PCR was used to amplify either the wild-type TSPOON gene (in Ax2) or the disrupted TSPOON gene. The resulting products were either left uncut (U) or digested with SmaI (S), which should not cut the wild-type gene, but should cleave the disrupted gene into three bands. Several clones are shown, including HM1725 (200/1 A1). (E) Spore viability after detergent treatment was used to test for integrity of the cellulosic spore and the ability to hatch in a timely manner. The control (Ax2) strain and the knockout (HM1725) strain both showed good viability. (F) Expansion rate of plaques on bacterial lawns. The rates for control (Ax2) and knockout (HM1725, 1727, and 1728) strains were similar initially, but by 2 days the control plaques were larger.

Numbers indicate posterior probabilities for MrBayes and PhyloBayes and maxium-likelihood bootstrap values for PhyML and RAxML, in that order. (B) Schematic diagram of TSET. (C) Possible evolution of the three families of heterotetramers: TSET, APs, and COPI. We propose that the earliest ancestral complex was a likely a heterotrimer or a heterohexamer formed from two identical heterotrimers, containing large (red), small (yellow), and scaffolding (blue) subunits. All three of these proteins were composed of known ancient building blocks of the membrane-trafficking system (Vedovato et al., 2009): α-solenoid domains in both the large and scaffolding subunits; two β-propellers in the scaffolding subunit; and a longin domain forming the small subunit. The gene encoding the large subunit then duplicated and mutated to generate the two distinct types of large subunits (red and magenta), and the gene encoding the small subunit also duplicated and mutated (yellow and orange), with one of the two proteins (orange) acquiring a μ homology domain (MHD) to form the ancestral heterotetramer, as proposed by Boehm and Bonifacino (12). However, the scaffolding subunit remained a homodimer. Upon diversification into three separate families, the scaffolding subunit duplicated independently in TSET and COPI, giving rise to TTRAY1 and TTRAY2 in TSET, and to α- and β′-COP in COPI. COPI also acquired a new subunit, ε-COP (purple). The scaffolding subunit may have been lost in the ancestral AP complex, as indicated in the diagram; however, AP-5 is tightly associated with two other proteins, SPG11 and SPG15, and the relationship of SPG11 and SPG15 to TTRAY/B-COPI remains unresolved, so it is possible that SPG11 and SPG15 are highly divergent descendants of the original scaffolding subunits. The other AP complexes are free heterotetramers when in the cytosol, but membrane-associated AP-1 and AP-2 interact with another scaffold, clathrin; and AP-3 has also been proposed to interact transiently with a protein with similar architecture, Vps41 (Rehling et al., 1999; Cabrera et al., 2010; Asensio et al., 2013). So far no scaffold has been proposed for AP-4. Although the order of emergence of TSET and COP relative to adaptins is unresolved, our most recent analyses indicate that, contrary to previous reports (Hirst et al., 2011), AP-5 diverged basally within the adaptin clade, followed by AP-3, AP-4, and APs 1 and 2, all prior to the LECA. This still suggests a primordial bridging of the secretory and phagocytic systems prior to emergence of a trans-Golgi network. The muniscins arose much later, in ancestral opisthokonts, from a translocation of the TSET MHD-encoding sequence to a position immediately downstream from an F-BAR domain-encoding sequence. Another translocation occurred in plants, where an SH3 domain-coding sequence was inserted at the 3′ end of the TSAUCER-coding sequence. See also Figure 4—figure supplements 1–10.
