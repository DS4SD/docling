DOI:  http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02866.001 eLife digest Eukaryotes make up almost all of the life on Earth that we can see around us, and include organisms as diverse as animals, fungi, plants, slime moulds, and seaweeds. The defining feature of eukaryotes is that, unlike nearly all bacteria, they have membrane-bound compartments\u2014such as the nucleus\u2014within their cells. Moving molecules, such as proteins, between these compartments is essential for living eukaryotic cells, and these molecules are usually trafficked inside membrane-bound packages called vesicles. Two similar sets of protein complexes\u2014each containing four different subunits\u2014ensure that the molecules are packaged inside the correct vesicles. However, it is not clear how these two protein complexes (called the AP complexes and the COPI complex) are related to each other, and when and where they originated in the history of life. Now, Hirst, Schlacht et al. have discovered a new\u2014but very ancient\u2013protein complex that they refer to as the \u2018missing link\u2019 between the AP and COPI complexes. The four subunits inside this new complex were found by searching for proteins with shapes that were similar to those of the AP and COPI proteins, rather than just searching for proteins with similar sequences of amino acids. This approach identified related protein subunits in groups as diverse as plants and slime moulds, which suggests that this protein complex evolved in the earliest of the eukaryotes. The four subunits identified in a slime mould were confirmed to interact, and also shown to bind to the plasma membrane of living cells. One of the subunits had already been named TPLATE, so Hirst, Schlacht et al. decided to call the complex TSET; the other three subunits were named TSAUCER, TCUP and TSPOON, and two other proteins that interacted with the complex were both called TTRAY. While most of the TSET complex itself has been lost from humans and other animals, one of subunit appears to have evolved into a family of proteins that help molecules get into cells. The discovery of TSET reveals another major player in vesicle-trafficking that is not only important for our understanding of how modern eukaryotes work, but also how ancient eukaryotes evolved.

      "orig": "The evolution of eukaryotes some 2 billion years ago radically changed the biosphere, giving rise to nearly all visible life on Earth. Key to this transition was the ability to generate intracellular membrane compartments and the trafficking pathways that interconnect them, mediated in part by the heterotetrameric adaptor complexes, APs 1\u20135 and COPI (Dacks et al., 2008; Field and Dacks, 2009; Hirst et al., 2011; Koumandou et al., 2013). In mammals, APs 1 and 2 and COPI are essential for viability, while mutations in the other APs cause severe genetic disorders (Boehm and Bonifacino, 2002; Hirst et al., 2013). The AP and COPI complexes share a similar architecture, due to common ancestry predating the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). All six complexes consist of two large subunits of \u223c100 kD, a medium subunit of \u223c50 kD, and a small subunit of \u223c20 kD (Figure 1A). Their function is to select cargo for packaging into transport vesicles, and together with membrane-deforming scaffolding proteins such as clathrin and the COPI B-subcomplex, they facilitate the trafficking of proteins and lipids between membrane compartments in the secretory and endocytic pathways. The recent discovery of the evolutionarily ancient AP-5 complex, found on late endosomes and lysosomes, added a new dimension to models of the endomembrane system, and raised the possibility that other undetected membrane-trafficking complexes might exist (Hirst et al., 2011). Therefore, we set out in search of additional members of the AP/COPI subunit families.",

In mammals, APs 1 and 2 and COPI are essential for viability, while mutations in the other APs cause severe genetic disorders (Boehm and Bonifacino, 2002; Hirst et al., 2013). The AP and COPI complexes share a similar architecture, due to common ancestry predating the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). All six complexes consist of two large subunits of \u223c100 kD, a medium subunit of \u223c50 kD, and a small subunit of \u223c20 kD (Figure 1A). Their function is to select cargo for packaging into transport vesicles, and together with membrane-deforming scaffolding proteins such as clathrin and the COPI B-subcomplex, they facilitate the trafficking of proteins and lipids between membrane compartments in the secretory and endocytic pathways. The recent discovery of the evolutionarily ancient AP-5 complex, found on late endosomes and lysosomes, added a new dimension to models of the endomembrane system, and raised the possibility that other undetected membrane-trafficking complexes might exist (Hirst et al., 2011). Therefore, we set out in search of additional members of the AP/COPI subunit families."

(C) Possible evolution of the three families of heterotetramers: TSET, APs, and COPI. We propose that the earliest ancestral complex was a likely a heterotrimer or a heterohexamer formed from two identical heterotrimers, containing large (red), small (yellow), and scaffolding (blue) subunits. All three of these proteins were composed of known ancient building blocks of the membrane-trafficking system (Vedovato et al., 2009): \u03b1-solenoid domains in both the large and scaffolding subunits; two \u03b2-propellers in the scaffolding subunit; and a longin domain forming the small subunit. The gene encoding the large subunit then duplicated and mutated to generate the two distinct types of large subunits (red and magenta), and the gene encoding the small subunit also duplicated and mutated (yellow and orange), with one of the two proteins (orange) acquiring a \u03bc homology domain (MHD) to form the ancestral heterotetramer, as proposed by Boehm and Bonifacino (12). However, the scaffolding subunit remained a homodimer. Upon diversification into three separate families, the scaffolding subunit duplicated independently in TSET and COPI, giving rise to TTRAY1 and TTRAY2 in TSET, and to \u03b1- and \u03b2\u2032-COP in COPI. COPI also acquired a new subunit, \u03b5-COP (purple). The scaffolding subunit may have been lost in the ancestral AP complex, as indicated in the diagram; however, AP-5 is tightly associated with two other proteins, SPG11 and SPG15, and the relationship of SPG11 and SPG15 to TTRAY/B-COPI remains unresolved, so it is possible that SPG11 and SPG15 are highly divergent descendants of the original scaffolding subunits. The other AP complexes are free heterotetramers when in the cytosol, but membrane-associated AP-1 and AP-2 interact with another scaffold, clathrin; and AP-3 has also been proposed to interact transiently with a protein with similar architecture, Vps41 (Rehling et al., 1999; Cabrera et al., 2010; Asensio et al., 2013). So far no scaffold has been proposed for AP-4. Although the order of emergence of TSET and COP relative to adaptins is unresolved, our most recent analyses indicate that, contrary to previous reports (Hirst et al., 2011), AP-5 diverged basally within the adaptin clade, followed by AP-3, AP-4, and APs 1 and 2, all prior to the LECA. This still suggests a primordial bridging of the secretory and phagocytic systems prior to emergence of a trans-Golgi network. The muniscins arose much later, in ancestral opisthokonts, from a translocation of the TSET MHD-encoding sequence to a position immediately downstream from an F-BAR domain-encoding sequence. Another translocation occurred in plants, where an SH3 domain-coding sequence was inserted at the 3\u2032 end of the TSAUCER-coding sequence. See also Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1\u201310.",

Dictyostelium has lost its TCUP MHD, and it seems likely that concomitant with this loss, it also lost some of TSET's binding partners and functions. Nevertheless, we suspect that TSET may predate clathrin-mediated endocytosis, for two reasons. First, AP-1 and AP-2, the two AP complexes that function together with clathrin, are the most recent additions to the AP family (Figure 4A); and second, TSET already has its own \u03b2-propeller + \u03b1-solenoid scaffold, so it is not clear why it would need clathrin as well. Thus, the interaction between TSET and the clathrin pathway may have evolved considerably later than TSET itself, although still pre-LECA. It is tempting to speculate that TSET was part of the original endocytic machinery, which then became redundant in some organisms as the clathrin pathway took over.",

(C) Possible evolution of the three families of heterotetramers: TSET, APs, and COPI. We propose that the earliest ancestral complex was a likely a heterotrimer or a heterohexamer formed from two identical heterotrimers, containing large (red), small (yellow), and scaffolding (blue) subunits. All three of these proteins were composed of known ancient building blocks of the membrane-trafficking system (Vedovato et al., 2009): \u03b1-solenoid domains in both the large and scaffolding subunits; two \u03b2-propellers in the scaffolding subunit; and a longin domain forming the small subunit. The gene encoding the large subunit then duplicated and mutated to generate the two distinct types of large subunits (red and magenta), and the gene encoding the small subunit also duplicated and mutated (yellow and orange), with one of the two proteins (orange) acquiring a \u03bc homology domain (MHD) to form the ancestral heterotetramer, as proposed by Boehm and Bonifacino (12). However, the scaffolding subunit remained a homodimer. Upon diversification into three separate families, the scaffolding subunit duplicated independently in TSET and COPI, giving rise to TTRAY1 and TTRAY2 in TSET, and to \u03b1- and \u03b2\u2032-COP in COPI. COPI also acquired a new subunit, \u03b5-COP (purple). The scaffolding subunit may have been lost in the ancestral AP complex, as indicated in the diagram; however, AP-5 is tightly associated with two other proteins, SPG11 and SPG15, and the relationship of SPG11 and SPG15 to TTRAY/B-COPI remains unresolved, so it is possible that SPG11 and SPG15 are highly divergent descendants of the original scaffolding subunits. The other AP complexes are free heterotetramers when in the cytosol, but membrane-associated AP-1 and AP-2 interact with another scaffold, clathrin; and AP-3 has also been proposed to interact transiently with a protein with similar architecture, Vps41 (Rehling et al., 1999; Cabrera et al., 2010; Asensio et al., 2013). So far no scaffold has been proposed for AP-4. Although the order of emergence of TSET and COP relative to adaptins is unresolved, our most recent analyses indicate that, contrary to previous reports (Hirst et al., 2011), AP-5 diverged basally within the adaptin clade, followed by AP-3, AP-4, and APs 1 and 2, all prior to the LECA. This still suggests a primordial bridging of the secretory and phagocytic systems prior to emergence of a trans-Golgi network. The muniscins arose much later, in ancestral opisthokonts, from a translocation of the TSET MHD-encoding sequence to a position immediately downstream from an F-BAR domain-encoding sequence. Another translocation occurred in plants, where an SH3 domain-coding sequence was inserted at the 3\u2032 end of the TSAUCER-coding sequence. See also Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1\u201310.
