  item-73 at level 1: picture
    item-73 at level 2: caption: Fig. 8. This schematic illustrates the proposed mechanism by which ibrutinib promotes atrial fibrillation (AF). Ibrutinib treatment leads to the downregulation of A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1), triggering mitochondrial quality surveillance (MQS) impairment. This results in enhanced translocation of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) to the mitochondria, driving mitochondrial fission. Concurrently, metabolic reprogramming is characterized by increased glycolysis and decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), alongside reduced mitochondrial biogenesis. These mitochondrial dysfunctions elevate oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, contributing to atrial metabolic and structural remodeling, ultimately leading to ibrutinib-induced AF.
