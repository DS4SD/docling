Although studies have explored the role of an impaired MQS system in both cardiovascular diseases and chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity like doxorubicin [11\u201313], the role of an altered MQS system and its upstream regulatory mechanisms in ibrutinib-induced AF have remained largely unexplored. A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1) is regarded as a crucial regulator of MQS including mitochondrial metabolism and dynamics. By anchoring the related proteins on the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), AKAP1 integrates multiple key pathways to influence mitochondrial morphology, function, and cellular fate. On one hand, AKAP1 promotes mitochondrial respiration and increases the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis rate by facilitating the phosphorylation of essential mitochondrial proteins like NDUFS4 and cytochrome c oxidase [14\u201316]. Furthermore, AKAP1 modulates the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation-mediated activation of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a key protein in mitochondrial fission, through interactions with various binding partners on the MOM, thereby exerting regulatory effects on the balance of mitochondrial dynamics [17].",

      "orig": "We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the ibrutinib-induced increased risk of AF. A proteomic analysis was conducted to compare the atrial protein expressions of both the ibrutinib-treated and control groups. The ibrutinib treatment modified the expression of 378 proteins in the murine atrial tissue (|log2 fold change| > 1; P-adj < 0.05). Of these, 170 proteins were up-regulated and 208 were down-regulated in the ibrutinib group (Fig. 1A and B). A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that mitochondrial metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, were significantly altered by the ibrutinib treatment. A Gene Ontology (GO) biological process enrichment analysis showed that the ibrutinib treatment primarily affected proteins involved in the mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial organization, and cellular respiration. Similarly, a GO cellular component enrichment analysis indicated that ibrutinib mainly influenced the proteins located in mitochondrial respiratory chain, mitochondrial membrane, and matrix of mitochondria (Fig. 1C to F). The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) plot demonstrated that ibrutinib up-regulated mitochondrial fission and ROS pathway but impaired OXPHOS and mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig. 1I to L). Hence, ibrutinib intervention appeared to modify the expression of atrial proteins responsible for mitochondrial structure and function.",
      "text": "We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the ibrutinib-induced increased risk of AF. A proteomic analysis was conducted to compare the atrial protein expressions of both the ibrutinib-treated and control groups. The ibrutinib treatment modified the expression of 378 proteins in the murine atrial tissue (|log2 fold change| > 1; P-adj < 0.05). Of these, 170 proteins were up-regulated and 208 were down-regulated in the ibrutinib group (Fig. 1A and B). A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that mitochondrial metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, were significantly altered by the ibrutinib treatment. A Gene Ontology (GO) biological process enrichment analysis showed that the ibrutinib treatment primarily affected proteins involved in the mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial organization, and cellular respiration. Similarly, a GO cellular component enrichment analysis indicated that ibrutinib mainly influenced the proteins located in mitochondrial respiratory chain, mitochondrial membrane, and matrix of mitochondria (Fig. 1C to F). The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) plot demonstrated that ibrutinib up-regulated mitochondrial fission and ROS pathway but impaired OXPHOS and mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig. 1I to L). Hence, ibrutinib intervention appeared to modify the expression of atrial proteins responsible for mitochondrial structure and function."

Indeed, the cardiotoxic side effects exhibited by a series of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are closely associated with the mitochondrial homeostasis disturbance. Sunitinib, a widely used vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, has been reported to have common cardiotoxicity with an incidence rate of 1% to 10% [1]. Mechanistic studies have revealed that sunitinib can induce myocardial apoptosis [38], which is manifested as the disruption of mitochondrial network structures [39], reduced efficiency of electron transfer, and the accompanying decrease in ATP production [8]. In H9c2 cardiac cell models exposed to sunitinib for 24 h and mouse models treated by gavage for 2 weeks, the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and elevated mitochondrial ROS can be observed. Intervention with mito-TEMPO can effectively alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction. Sorafenib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has emerged as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Evidence suggests that at the therapeutically relevant doses, sorafenib can directly compromise the mitochondrial function of H9c2 cardiomyocytes [40]. The mechanism underlying this cardiotoxicity may be attributed to sorafenib\u2019s role as an effective ferroptosis inducer [41]. Ferroptosis is typically associated with substantial alterations in mitochondrial morphology, characterized by increased mitochondrial membrane density and reduced mitochondrial cristae [42]. Furthermore, sorafenib has been shown to activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase downstream pathways, leading to disruption of mitochondrial respiration and induction of apoptosis [43]. Imatinib, which functions through inhibiting the activity of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, has become the standard treatment for Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia. However, reports from both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro studies have highlighted its potential cardiotoxicity. Ultrastructural analysis of cardiac tissue from patients undergoing imatinib therapy has revealed the presence of pleomorphic mitochondria with disrupted cristae. In\u00a0vitro experiments have provided further insights into the mechanisms of this cardiotoxicity. Cardiomyocytes exposed to imatinib for 24 h demonstrate activation of mitochondrial death pathways, triggered by PERK-eIF2\u03b1 signaling.

The electrode was introduced through the esophagus in close proximity to the LA, to capture ECGs with PowerLab and LabChart\u00a07 software. Rapid pacing (10 ms at 30 Hz) was employed to evaluate susceptibility to pacing-induced AF. The AF phenotype was identified by distinguishing it from sinus rhythm phenotype when the ECGs demonstrated an absence of distinct P waves. We used this characteristic to differentiate AF from sinus rhythm. The restoration of sinus rhythm was confirmed by observing the detectable P waves.
