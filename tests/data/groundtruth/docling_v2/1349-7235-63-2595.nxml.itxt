    item-42 at level 2: caption: Figure 1. Thirty-day cumulative survival rates in patients with acute myocardial infarction, stratified by DM status. Patients with DM (shown in red) had a significantly lower survival rate than those without DM (shown in blue).
  item-44 at level 1: picture
    item-44 at level 2: caption: Figure 2. Pie charts illustrating the causes of death in each group reveal differences. In the DM group, a higher percentage of non-cardiac deaths, such as infections, malignancies, strokes, and multiple organ failures, was observed than in the non-DM group (32% vs. 14%, respectively), with a statistically significant difference (p=0.046). Among the six cases of mechanical complications in patients who died in the DM group, there were two cases of ventricular septal rupture (VSR) and four cases of free-wall rupture (FWR). In the non-DM group, out of the 12 cases of mechanical complications in deceased patients, there were 4 cases of VSR, 7 of FMR, and 1 of papillary muscle rupture (PMR).
