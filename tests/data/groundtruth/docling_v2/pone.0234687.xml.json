The proportion of pasture on diets may affect all these factors, mainly in subtropical climate zones, where cows may access tropical and temperate pastures during warm and cold seasons, respectively. The aim of the study was to assess the C footprint of a dairy system with annual tropical and temperate pastures in a subtropical region. The system boundary included all processes up to the animal farm gate. Feed requirement during the entire life of each cow was based on data recorded from Holstein \u00d7 Jersey cow herds producing an average of 7,000 kg ECM lactation-1. The milk production response as consequence of feed strategies (scenarios) was based on results from two experiments (warm and cold seasons) using lactating cows from the same herd. Three scenarios were evaluated: total mixed ration (TMR) ad libitum intake, 75, and 50% of ad libitum TMR intake with access to grazing either a tropical or temperate pasture during lactation periods. Considering IPCC and international literature values to estimate emissions from urine/dung, feed production and electricity, the C footprint was similar between scenarios, averaging 1.06 kg CO2e (kg ECM)-1. Considering factors from studies conducted in subtropical conditions and actual inputs for on-farm feed production, the C footprint decreased 0.04 kg CO2e (kg ECM)-1 in scenarios including pastures compared to ad libitum TMR. Regardless of factors considered, emissions from feed production decreased as the proportion of pasture went up. In conclusion, decreasing TMR intake and including pastures in dairy cow diets in subtropical conditions have the potential to maintain or reduce the C footprint to a small extent.",

Considering the C sequestration from no-tillage perennial pasture, the amount of C sequestration will more than compensates for C emitted.

If 50% of tilled areas were under perennial grasslands, 1.0 t C ha-1 would be sequestered, further reducing the C footprint by 0.015 and 0.025 kg CO2e (kg ECM)-1 for the scenarios using 75 and 50% TMR, respectively. Eliminating tillage, the reduction on total GHG emissions would be 0.03 and 0.05 kg CO2e (kg ECM)-1 for 75 and 50% TMR, respectively. However, this approach may be controversial because lands which have been consistently managed for decades have approached steady state C storage, so that net exchange of CO2 would be negligible [76].",
      "text": "Grazing lands may also improve biodiversity [73]. Strategies such as zero tillage may increase stocks of soil C [74]. This study did not consider C sequestration during the growth of annual pastures, because it was assumed these grasses were planted with tillage, having a balance between C sequestration and C emissions [38]. Considering the C sequestration from no-tillage perennial pasture, the amount of C sequestration will more than compensates for C emitted. These results are in agreement with other authors who have shown that a reduction or elimination of soil tillage increases annual soil C sequestration in subtropical areas by 0.5 to 1.5 t ha-1 [75]. If 50% of tilled areas were under perennial grasslands, 1.0 t C ha-1 would be sequestered, further reducing the C footprint by 0.015 and 0.025 kg CO2e (kg ECM)-1 for the scenarios using 75 and 50% TMR, respectively. Eliminating tillage, the reduction on total GHG emissions would be 0.03 and 0.05 kg CO2e (kg ECM)-1 for 75 and 50% TMR, respectively.
