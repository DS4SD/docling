      "orig": "Background Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common condition associated with significant mortality due to pulmonary embolism. Despite advanced prevention and anticoagulation therapy, the incidence of venous thromboembolism remains unchanged. Individuals with elevated hematocrit and/or excessively high erythropoietin (EPO) serum levels are particularly susceptible to DVT formation. We investigated the influence of short-term EPO administration compared to chronic EPO overproduction on DVT development. Additionally, we examined the role of the spleen in this context and assessed its impact on thrombus composition. Methods We induced ligation of the caudal vena cava (VCC) in EPO-overproducing Tg(EPO) mice as well as wildtype mice treated with EPO for two weeks, both with and without splenectomy. The effect on platelet circulation time was evaluated through FACS analysis, and thrombus composition was analyzed using immunohistology. Results We present evidence for an elevated thrombogenic phenotype resulting from chronic EPO overproduction, achieved by combining an EPO-overexpressing mouse model with experimental DVT induction. This increased thrombotic state is largely independent of traditional contributors to DVT, such as neutrophils and platelets. Notably, the pronounced prothrombotic effect of red blood cells (RBCs) only manifests during chronic EPO overproduction and is not influenced by splenic RBC clearance, as demonstrated by splenectomy. In contrast, short-term EPO treatment does not induce thrombogenesis in mice. Consequently, our findings support the existence of a differential thrombogenic effect between chronic enhanced erythropoiesis and exogenous EPO administration. Conclusion Chronic EPO overproduction significantly increases the risk of DVT, while short-term EPO treatment does not. These findings underscore the importance of considering EPO-related factors in DVT risk assessment and potential therapeutic strategies.",

      "orig": "Red blood cells (RBCs) are the primary carriers oxygen and carbon dioxide in all mammals. Low hemoglobin concentrations in the blood can cause severe oxygen deficiency, leading to ischemia in organs and tissues. At the same time, numerous clinical observations identified elevated hemoglobin levels as an independent risk factor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) formation. This applies to overproduction of RBCs due to erythropoietin (EPO) administration, as well as foreign blood transfusions. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 This is also evident in illnesses which exhibit an excessive RBC production such as polycythemia vera or Chuvash polycythemia where a significant increase in thromboembolic complications has been reported. 8 9 In such cases, oral or parenteral anticoagulants are effective preventive measures. However, their use entails significant drawbacks in the form of elevated bleeding risks, which can lead to severe complications. 10 Therefore, it is crucial to identify patients at risk and to expand our understanding of the pathophysiology to enable a more targeted prevention and treatment of DVT.",

Low hemoglobin concentrations in the blood can cause severe oxygen deficiency, leading to ischemia in organs and tissues. At the same time, numerous clinical observations identified elevated hemoglobin levels as an independent risk factor for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) formation. This applies to overproduction of RBCs due to erythropoietin (EPO) administration, as well as foreign blood transfusions. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 This is also evident in illnesses which exhibit an excessive RBC production such as polycythemia vera or Chuvash polycythemia where a significant increase in thromboembolic complications has been reported. 8 9 In such cases, oral or parenteral anticoagulants are effective preventive measures. However, their use entails significant drawbacks in the form of elevated bleeding risks, which can lead to severe complications. 10 Therefore, it is crucial to identify patients at risk and to expand our understanding of the pathophysiology to enable a more targeted prevention and treatment of DVT."

We speculate that morphological changes in the bone marrow are long-term consequences of EPO administration. In peripheral blood, we observed a significant increase in the platelet large cell ratio in mice treated with EPO for 2 weeks. This is likely due to an elevated count of reticulated platelets, which has been previously observed in response to EPO treatment. 47 The presence of high levels of reticulated platelets indicates a high synthetic potential of megakaryocytes. Indeed, megakaryocytes possess high-affinity binding sites for EPO resulting in an increase in size, ploidy, and number of megakaryocytes in vitro. 48 49 Young, reticulated platelets are known risk factors for thrombosis, which may counterbalance the overall low platelet count in terms of thrombogenicity. 50 51 52 However, the significant increase in DVT observed in chronic EPO-overexpressing mice is likely attributed to qualitative changes in RBCs. There are several ways in which RBCs can interact with platelets and fibrin. The FAS-L-FAS-R interplay between RBCs and platelets has been shown to enhance DVT formation. 31 Additionally, interactions such as ICAM-4\u2013\u03b11b\u03b23 integrin and adhesion between RBCs and platelets mediated by GPIb and CD36 have been described. 53 54 As demonstrated in this study, the pronounced prothrombotic effect of RBCs only manifests after several weeks to months of EPO overproduction.
