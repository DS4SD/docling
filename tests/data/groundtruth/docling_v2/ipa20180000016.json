It is known that nitrite ion acts to hemoglobin in blood, and it is known that a nitroso compound sometimes affects health of a human body. Mechanism of converting nitrate nitrogen into nitrite ion in vivo is complicated, and the relationship between the amount of intake of nitrate nitrogen and the influence to health of a human body is not clarified. However, it is desired that the content of nitrate nitrogen having a possibility of affecting health of a human body is smaller."
