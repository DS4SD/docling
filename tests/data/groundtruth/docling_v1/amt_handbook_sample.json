Until the nut is tightened, it spins on the bolt easily, because the threaded insert is the proper size for the bolt. However, when the nut is seated against a solid surface and tightened, the locking shoulder of the insert is pulled downward and wedged against the locking shoulder of the case. This action compresses the threaded insert and causes it to clench the bolt tightly. The cross-sectional view in Figure 7-27 shows how the key of the case fits into the slotted keyway of the insert so that when the case is turned, the threaded insert is turned with it.
