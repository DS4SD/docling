<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a light emitting device and a plant cultivation method.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With environmental changes due to climate change and other artificial disruptions, plant factories are expected to increase production efficiency of vegetables and be capable of adjusting production in order to make it possible to stably supply vegetables. Plant factories that are capable of artificial management can stably supply clean and safe vegetables to markets, and therefore are expected to be the next-generation industries.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Plant factories that are completely isolated from external environment make it possible to artificially control and collect various data such as growth method, growth rate data, yield data, depending on classification of plants. Based on those data, plant factories are able to plan production according to the balance between supply and demand in markets, and supply plants such as vegetables without depending on surrounding conditions such as climatic environment. Particularly, an increase in food production is indispensable with world population growth. If plants can be systematically produced without the influence by surrounding conditions such as climatic environment, vegetables produced in plant factories can be stably supplied within a country, and additionally can be exported abroad as viable products.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, vegetables that are grown outdoors get sunlight, grow while conducting photosynthesis, and are gathered. On the other hand, vegetables that are grown in plant factories are required to be harvested in a short period of time, or are required to grow in larger than normal sizes even in an ordinary growth period.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In plant factories, the light source used in place of sunlight affect a growth period, growth of plants. LED lighting is being used in place of conventional fluorescent lamps, from a standpoint of power consumption reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2009-125007 discloses a plant growth method. In this method, the plants is irradiated with light emitted from a first LED light emitting element and/or a second LED light emitting element at predetermined timings using a lighting apparatus including the first LED light emitting element emitting light having a wavelength region of 625 to 690 nm and the second LED light emitting element emitting light having a wavelength region of 420 to 490 nm in order to emit lights having sufficient intensities and different wavelengths from each other.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, even though plants are merely irradiated with lights having different wavelengths as in the plant growth method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2009-125007, the effect of promoting plant growth is not sufficient. Further improvement is required in promotion of plant growth.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, an object of the present disclosure is to provide a light emitting device capable of promoting growth of plants and a plant cultivation method.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Means for solving the above problems are as follows, and the present disclosure includes the following embodiments.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="2">Light Emitting Device</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An embodiment of the present disclosure is a light emitting device including a light emitting element having a light emission peak wavelength in a range of 380 nm or more and 490 nm or less (hereinafter sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;region of from near ultraviolet to blue color&#x201d;), and a first fluorescent material emitting light having at least one light emission peak wavelength in a range of 580 nm or more and less than 680 nm by being excited by light from the light emitting element. The light emitting device emits light having a ratio R/B of a photon flux density R to a photon flux density B within a range of 2.0 or more and 4.0 or less, and a ratio R/FR of the photon flux density R to a photon flux density FR within a range of 0.7 or more and 13.0 or less, where the photon flux density R is the number of light quanta (&#x3bc;mol&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>&#xb7;g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) incident per unit time and unit area in a wavelength range of 620 nm or more and less than 700 nm, the photon flux density B is the number of light quanta (&#x3bc;mol&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>&#xb7;g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) incident per unit time and unit area in a wavelength range of 380 nm or more and 490 nm or less, and the photon flux density FR is the number of light quanta (&#x3bc;mol&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>&#xb7;g<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) incident per unit time and unit area in a wavelength range of 700 nm or more and 780 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An example of the light emitting device according to one embodiment of the present disclosure is described below based on the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic cross sectional view showing a light emitting device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The light emitting device <b>100</b> includes a molded article <b>40</b>, a light emitting element <b>10</b> and a fluorescent member <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The molded article <b>40</b> includes a first lead <b>20</b> and a second lead <b>30</b> that are integrally molded with a resin portion <b>42</b> containing a thermoplastic resin or a thermosetting resin. The molded article <b>40</b> forms a depression having a bottom and sides, and the light emitting element <b>10</b> is placed on the bottom of the depression. The light emitting element <b>10</b> has a pair of an anode and a cathode, and the anode and the cathode are electrically connected to the first lead <b>20</b> and the second lead <b>30</b> respectively through the respective wires <b>60</b>. The light emitting element <b>10</b> is covered with the fluorescent member <b>50</b>. The fluorescent member <b>50</b> includes, for example, a fluorescent material <b>70</b> performing wavelength conversion of light from the light emitting element <b>10</b>, and a resin. The fluorescent material <b>70</b> includes a first fluorescent material <b>71</b> and a second fluorescent material <b>72</b>. A part of the first lead <b>20</b> and the second lead <b>30</b> that are connected to a pair of the anode and the cathode of the light emitting element <b>10</b> is exposed toward outside a package constituting the light emitting element <b>100</b>. The light emitting device <b>100</b> can emit light by receiving electric power supply from the outside through the first lead <b>20</b> and the second lead <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The fluorescent member <b>50</b> not only performs wavelength conversion of light emitted from the light emitting element <b>10</b>, but functions as a member for protecting the light emitting element <b>10</b> from the external environment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the fluorescent material <b>70</b> is localized in the fluorescent member <b>50</b> in the state that the first fluorescent material <b>71</b> and the second fluorescent material <b>72</b> are mixed with each other, and is arranged adjacent to the light emitting element <b>10</b>. This constitution can efficiently perform the wavelength conversion of light from the light emitting element <b>10</b> in the fluorescent material <b>70</b>, and as a result, can provide a light emitting device having excellent light emission efficiency. The arrangement of the fluorescent member <b>50</b> containing the fluorescent material <b>70</b>, and the light emitting element <b>10</b> is not limited to the embodiment that the fluorescent material <b>70</b> is arranged adjacent to the light emitting element <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and considering the influence of heat generated from the light emitting element <b>10</b>, the fluorescent material <b>70</b> can be arranged separated from the light emitting element <b>10</b> in the fluorescent member <b>50</b>. Furthermore, light having suppressed color unevenness can be emitted from the light emitting device <b>100</b> by arranging the fluorescent material <b>70</b> almost evenly in the fluorescent member <b>50</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the fluorescent material <b>70</b> is arranged in the state that the first fluorescent material <b>71</b> and the second fluorescent material <b>72</b> are mixed with each other. However, for example, the first fluorescent material <b>71</b> may be arranged in a layer state and the second fluorescent material <b>72</b> may be arranged thereon in another layer state. Alternatively, the second fluorescent material <b>72</b> may be arranged in a layer state and the first fluorescent material <b>71</b> may be arranged thereon in another layer state.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The light emitting device <b>100</b> includes the first fluorescent material <b>71</b> having at least one light emission peak wavelength in a range of 580 nm or more and less than 680 nm by being excited by light from the light emitting element <b>10</b>, and preferably further includes the second fluorescent material <b>72</b> having at least one light emission peak wavelength in a range of 680 nm or more and 800 nm or less by being excited by light from the light emitting element <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first fluorescent material <b>71</b> and the second fluorescent material <b>72</b> are contained in, for example, the fluorescent member <b>50</b> covering the light emitting element <b>10</b>. The light emitting device <b>100</b> in which the light emitting element <b>10</b> has been covered with the fluorescent member <b>50</b> containing the first fluorescent material <b>71</b> and the second fluorescent material <b>72</b> emits light having at least one light emission peak wavelength in a range of 580 nm or more and less than 680 nm by a part of light emission of the light emitting element <b>10</b> that is absorbed in the first fluorescent material <b>71</b>. Furthermore, the light emitting device <b>100</b> emits light having at least one light emission peak wavelength in a range of 680 nm or more and 800 nm or less by a part of light emission of the light emitting element <b>10</b> that is absorbed in the second fluorescent material <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Plants grow when a pigment (chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b) present in chlorophyll thereof absorbs light and additionally takes carbon dioxide gas and water therein, and these are converted to carbohydrates (saccharides) by photosynthesis. Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b used in growth promotion of plants particularly have absorption peaks in a red region of 625 nm or more and 675 nm or less and a blue region of 425 nm or more and 475 nm or less. The action of photosynthesis by chlorophylls of plants mainly occurs in a wavelength range of 400 nm or more and 700 nm or less, but chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b further have local absorption peaks in a region of 700 nm or more and 800 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, when plants are irradiated with light having longer wavelength than and absorption peak (in the vicinity of 680 nm) in a red region of chlorophyll a, a phenomenon called red drop, in which activity of photosynthesis rapidly decreases, occurs. However, it is known that when plants are irradiated with light containing near infrared region together with light of red region, photosynthesis is accelerated by a synergistic effect of those two kinds of lights. This phenomenon is called the Emerson effect.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Intensity of light with which plants are irradiated is represented by photon flux density. The photon flux density (&#x3bc;mol&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>&#xb7;s<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) is the number of photons reaching a unit area per unit time. The amount of photosynthesis depends on the number of photons, and therefore does not depend on other optical characteristics if the photon flux density is the same. However, wavelength dependency activating photosynthesis differs depending on photosynthetic pigment. Intensity of light necessary for photosynthesis of plants is sometimes represented by Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD).</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is estimated that in plants, which are irradiated with light containing the photon flux density FR from the light emitting device <b>100</b>, photosynthesis is activated by Emerson effect, and as a result, growth of plants can be promoted. Furthermore, when plants are irradiated with light containing the photon flux density FR, growth of the plants can be promoted by a reversible reaction between red light irradiation, to which chlorophyll as chromoprotein contained in plants has participated, and far infrared light irradiation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Examples of nutrients necessary for growth of plants include nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potassium. Of those nutrients, nitrogen is absorbed in plants as nitrate nitrogen (nitrate ion: NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>). The nitrate nitrogen changes into nitrite ion (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) by a reduction reaction, and when the nitrite ion is further reacted with fatty acid amine, nitrosoamine is formed. It is known that nitrite ion acts to hemoglobin in blood, and it is known that a nitroso compound sometimes affects health of a human body. Mechanism of converting nitrate nitrogen into nitrite ion in vivo is complicated, and the relationship between the amount of intake of nitrate nitrogen and the influence to health of a human body is not clarified. However, it is desired that the content of nitrate nitrogen having a possibility of affecting health of a human body is smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For the above reasons, nitrogen is one of nutrients necessary for growth of plants, but it is preferred that the content of nitrate nitrogen in food plants be reduced to a range that does not disturb the growth of plants.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0068">From the standpoint of stability of a crystal structure, the temperature for heat-treating the raw material mixture is preferably in a range of 1,000&#xb0; C. or higher and 2,100&#xb0; C. or lower, more preferably in a range of 1,100&#xb0; C. or higher and 2,000&#xb0; C. or lower, still more preferably in a range of 1,200&#xb0; C. or higher and 1,900&#xb0; C. or lower, and particularly preferably in a range of 1,300&#xb0; C. or higher and 1,800&#xb0; C. or lower. The heat treatment can use an electric furnace or a gas furnace.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0070">The atmosphere for heat-treating the raw material mixture is an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen, a reducing atmosphere containing hydrogen, or an oxidizing atmosphere such as the air. The raw material mixture may be subjected to a two-stage heat treatment of a first heat treatment of heat-treating in the air or a weakly reducing atmosphere from the standpoint of, for example, prevention of blackening, and a second heat treatment of heat-treating in a reducing atmosphere from the standpoint of enhancing absorption efficiency of light having a specific light emission peak wavelength. The fluorescent material constituting a garnet structure is that reactivity of the raw material mixture is improved in an atmosphere having high reducing power such as a reducing atmosphere. Therefore, the fluorescent material can be heat-treated under the atmospheric pressure without pressurizing. For example, the heat treatment can be conducted by the method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application No. 2014-260421.</p>

<heading id="h-0027" level="2">Plant Cultivation Test</heading>
<p id="p-0119" num="0090">The plant cultivation method includes a method of conducting by &#x201c;growth period by RGB light source (hereinafter referred to as a first growth period)&#x201d; and &#x201c;growth period by light source for plant growth (hereinafter referred to as a second growth period)&#x201d; using a light emitting device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure as a light source.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0091">The first growth period uses RGB light source, and RGB type LED generally known can be used as the RGB light source. The reason for irradiating plants with RGB type LED in the initial stage of the plant growth is that length of a stem and the number and size of true leaves in the initial stage of plant growth are made equal, thereby clarifying the influence by the difference of light quality in the second growth period.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0092">The first growth period is preferably about 2 weeks. In the case where the first growth period is shorter than 2 weeks, it is necessary to confirm that two true leaves develop and a root reaches length that can surely absorb water in the second growth period. In the case where the first growth period exceeds 2 weeks, variation in the second growth period tends to increase. The variation is easy to be controlled by RGB light source by which stem extension is inhibitory, rather than a fluorescent lamp by which stem extension is easy to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0093">After completion of the first growth period, the second growth period immediately proceeds. It is preferred that plants are irradiated with light emitted from a light emitting device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Photosynthesis of plants is activated by irradiating plants with light emitted from the light emitting device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, and the growth of plants can be promoted so as to have favorable form and weight.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0094">The total growth period of the first growth period and the second growth period is about 4 to 6 weeks, and it is preferred that shippable plants can be obtained within the period.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0095">The cultivation test was specifically conducted by the following method.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0096">Romaine lettuce (green romaine, produced by Nakahara Seed Co., Ltd.) was used as cultivation plant.</p>

<heading id="h-0029" level="2">Second Growth Period</heading>
<p id="p-0127" num="0098">After the first growth period, the plants were irradiated with light from the light emitting devices of Examples 1 to 5 and Comparative Example 1, and were subjected to hydroponics.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0099">The plants were cultivated for 19 days under the conditions of room temperature: 22 to 24&#xb0; C., humidity: 60 to 70%, CO<sub>2 </sub>concentration: 600 to 700 ppm, photon flux density from light emitting device: 125 &#x3bc;mol&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>&#xb7;s<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and daytime hour: 16 hours/day. Otsuka Formulation A was used as the nutrient solution. Conductivity of the nutrient was 1.5 ms&#xb7;cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The values of the R/B and R/FR ratios of light for plant irradiation from each light emitting device in the second growth period are shown in Table 1.</p>
<heading id="h-0030" level="2">Measurement of Fresh Weight (Edible Part)</heading>
<p id="p-0129" num="0100">The plants after cultivation were harvested, and wet weights of a terrestrial part and a root were measured. The wet weight of a terrestrial part of each of 6 cultivated plants having been subjected to hydroponics by irradiating with light from the light emitting devices of Examples 1 to 5 and Comparative Example 1 was measured as a fresh weight (edible part) (g). The results obtained are shown in Table 1 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0031" level="2">Measurement of Nitrate Nitrogen Content</heading>
<p id="p-0130" num="0101">The edible part (about 20 g) of each of the cultivated plants, from which a foot about 5 cm had been removed, was frozen with liquid nitrogen and crushed with a juice mixer (laboratory mixer LM-PLUS, manufactured by Osaka Chemical Co., Ltd.) for 1 minute. The resulting liquid was filtered with Miracloth (manufactured by Milipore), and the filtrate was centrifuged at 4&#xb0; C. and 15,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The nitrate nitrogen content (mg/100 g) in the cultivated plant in the supernatant was measured using a portable reflection photometer system (product name: RQ flex system, manufactured by Merck) and a test paper (product name: Reflectoquant (registered trade mark), manufactured by Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.). The results are shown in Table 1 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0132" num="0102">As shown in Table 1, for the light emitting devices in Examples 1 to 5, the R/B ratios are within a range of 2.0 or more and 4.0 or less and the R/FR ratios are within the range of 0.7 or more and 13.0 or less. For Romaine lettuce cultivated by irradiating with light from the light emitting device in Examples 1 to 5, the fresh weight (edible part) was increased as compared with Romaine lettuce cultivated by irradiating with light from the light emitting device used in Comparative Example 1. Therefore, cultivation of plants was promoted, as shown in Table 1 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the light emitting device <b>100</b> in Example 1 had at least one maximum value of the relative photon flux density in a range of 380 nm or more and 490 nm or less and in a range of 580 nm or more and less than 680 nm. The light emitting devices <b>100</b> in Examples 2 to 5 had at least one maximum value of relative photon flux density in a range of 380 nm or more and 490 nm or less, in a range of 580 nm or more and less than 680 nm and in a range of 680 nm or more and 800 nm or less, respectively. The maximum value of the relative photon flux density in a range of 380 nm or more and 490 nm or less is due to the light emission of the light emitting element having light emission peak wavelength in a range of 380 nm or more and 490 nm or less, the maximum value of the relative photon flux density in a range of 580 nm or more and less than 680 nm is due to the first fluorescent material emitting the light having at least one light emission peak wavelength in a range of 580 nm or more and less than 680 nm, and the maximum value of the relative photon flux density in a range of 680 nm or more and 800 nm or less is due to the second fluorescent material emitting the light having at least one light emission peak wavelength in a range of 680 nm or more and 800 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0104">As shown in Table 1, for the light emitting devices <b>100</b> in Examples 4 and 5, the R/B ratios are 2.0 and 2.3, respectively, and the R/FR ratios are 1.6 and 1.4, respectively. The R/B ratios are within a range of 2.0 or more and 4.0 or less, and the R/FR ratios are within a range of 0.7 or more and 2.0 or less. For Romaine lettuces cultivated by irradiating with lights from the light emitting devices <b>100</b>, the nitrate nitrogen content is decreased as compared with Comparative Example 1. Plants, in which the nitrate nitrogen content having the possibility of adversely affecting health of human body had been reduced to a range that does not inhibit the cultivation of plants, could be cultivated, as shown in Table 1 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
