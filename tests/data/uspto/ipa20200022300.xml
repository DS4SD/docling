<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to seed planting implements and, more particularly, to systems for controlling the operation of an actuator mounted on a seed planting implement in a manner that provides damping to one or more components of the seed planting implement.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Modern farming practices strive to increase yields of agricultural fields. In this respect, seed planting implements are towed behind a tractor or other work vehicle to deposit seeds in a field. For example, seed planting implements typically include one or more ground engaging tools or openers that form a furrow or trench in the soil. One or more dispensing devices of the seed planting implement may, in turn, deposit seeds into the furrow(s). After deposition of the seeds, a packer wheel may pack the soil on top of the deposited seeds.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In certain instances, the packer wheel may also control the penetration depth of the furrow. In this regard, the position of the packer wheel may be moved vertically relative to the associated opener(s) to adjust the depth of the furrow. Additionally, the seed planting implement includes an actuator configured to exert a downward force on the opener(s) to ensure that the opener(s) is able to penetrate the soil to the depth set by the packer wheel. However, the seed planting implement may bounce or chatter when traveling at high speeds and/or when the opener(s) encounters hard or compacted soil. As such, operators generally operate the seed planting implement with the actuator exerting more downward force on the opener(s) than is necessary in order to prevent such bouncing or chatter. Operation of the seed planting implement with excessive down pressure applied to the opener(s), however, reduces the overall stability of the seed planting implement.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, an improved system for controlling the operation of an actuator mounted on s seed planting implement to enhance the overall operation of the implement would be welcomed in the technology.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aspects and advantages of the technology will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the technology.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the present subject matter is directed to a system for controlling an operation of an actuator mounted on a seed planting implement. The system may include a toolbar and a row unit adjustably mounted on the toolbar. The system may also include a fluid-driven actuator configured to adjust a position of the row unit relative to the toolbar, with the fluid-driven actuator defining first and second fluid chambers. Furthermore, the system may include a flow restrictor fluidly coupled to the first fluid chamber, with the flow restrictor being configured to reduce a rate at which fluid is permitted to exit the first fluid chamber in a manner that provides viscous damping to the row unit. Additionally, the system may include a valve fluidly coupled to the first fluid chamber. The valve may further be fluidly coupled to the flow restrictor in a parallel relationship such that the valve is configured to permit the fluid exiting the first fluid chamber to flow through the flow restrictor and the fluid entering the first fluid chamber to bypass the flow restrictor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect, the present subject matter is directed to a seed planting implement including a toolbar and a plurality of row units adjustably coupled to the toolbar. Each row unit may include a ground engaging tool configured to form a furrow in the soil. The seed planting implement may also include plurality of fluid-driven actuators, with each fluid-driven actuator being coupled between the toolbar and a corresponding row unit of the plurality of row units. As such, each fluid-driven actuator may be configured to adjust a position of the corresponding row unit relative to the toolbar. Moreover, each fluid-driven actuator may define first and second fluid chambers. Furthermore, the seed planting implement may include a flow restrictor fluidly coupled to the first fluid chamber of a first fluid-driven actuator of the plurality of fluid-driven actuators. The flow restrictor may be configured to reduce a rate at which fluid is permitted to exit the first fluid chamber of the first fluid-driven actuator in a manner that provides viscous damping to the corresponding row unit. Additionally, the seed planting implement may include a valve fluidly coupled to the first fluid chamber of the first fluid-driven actuator. The valve further may be fluidly coupled to the flow restrictor in a parallel relationship such that the valve is configured to permit the fluid exiting the first fluid chamber to flow through the flow restrictor and the fluid entering the first fluid chamber to bypass the flow restrictor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further aspect, the present subject matter is directed to a system for providing damping to a row unit of a seed planting implement. The system may include a toolbar, a row unit adjustably mounted on the toolbar, and a fluid-driven actuator configured to adjust a position of the row unit relative to the toolbar. As such, the fluid-driven actuator may define a fluid chamber. The system may also include a flow restrictor fluidly coupled to the fluid chamber. The flow restrictor may define an adjustable throat configured to reduce a rate at which fluid is permitted to exit the fluid chamber. In this regard, the throat may be adjustable between a first size configured to provide a first damping rate to the row unit and a second size configured to provide a second damping rate to the row unit, with the first and second damping rates being different.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In general, the present subject matter is directed to systems for controlling the operation of an actuator mounted on a seed planting implement. Specifically, the disclosed systems may be configured to control the operation of the actuator in a manner that provides damping to one or more components of the seed planting implement. For example, in several embodiments, the seed planting implement may include a toolbar and one or more row units adjustably coupled to the toolbar. One or more fluid-driven actuators of the seed planting implement may be configured to control and/or adjust the position of the row unit(s) relative to the toolbar. Furthermore, a flow restrictor may be fluidly coupled to a fluid chamber of the actuator and configured to reduce the rate at which fluid is permitted to exit the fluid chamber so as to provide viscous damping to the row unit(s). In this regard, when the row unit(s) moves relative to the toolbar (e.g., when the row unit contacts a rock or other impediment in the soil), the flow restrictor may be configured to reduce the relative speed and/or displacement of such movement, thereby damping the movement of the row unit(s) relative to the toolbar.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, the flow restrictor may be configured to provide a variable damping rate to the component(s) of the seed planting implement. Specifically, in such embodiment, the flow restrictor may be configured as an adjustable valve having one or more components that may be adjusted to change the size of a fluid passage or throat defined by the valve. In this regard, changing the throat size of the valve varies the rate at which the fluid may exit the fluid chamber of the actuator, thereby adjusting the damping rate provided by the disclosed system. For example, adjusting the valve so as to increase the size of the throat may allow the fluid to exit the fluid chamber more quickly, thereby reducing the damping rate of the system. Conversely, adjusting the valve so as to decrease the size of the throat may allow the fluid to exit the fluid chamber more slowly, thereby increasing the damping rate of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with aspects of the present subject matter, the system may further include a check valve fluidly coupled to the fluid chamber of the actuator. Specifically, in several embodiments, the check valve may also be fluidly coupled to the flow restrictor in a parallel relationship. As such, the check valve may be configured to direct the fluid exiting the fluid chamber of the actuator (e.g., when one of the row units hits a rock) to flow through the flow restrictor, thereby reducing the relative speed and/or displacement between the row unit(s) in the toolbar. Furthermore, the check valve may be configured to permit the fluid entering the fluid chamber to bypass the flow restrictor. For example, the fluid may return to the fluid chamber as the row unit(s) returns to its initial position following contact with the rock. In this regard, allowing the returning fluid to bypass the flow restrictor may increase the rate at which the fluid flows back into the fluid chamber, thereby further increasing the damping provided by the disclosed system.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown, the row unit <b>20</b> may be adjustably coupled to one of the tool frames <b>18</b> of the implement <b>10</b> by a suitable linkage assembly <b>22</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the linkage assembly <b>22</b> may include a mounting bracket <b>24</b> coupled to the tool frame <b>18</b>.

One end of each linkage member <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> may be pivotably coupled to the mounting bracket <b>24</b>, while an opposed end of each linkage member <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> may be pivotally coupled to a support member <b>30</b> of the row unit <b>20</b>. In this regard, the linkage assembly <b>22</b> may form a four bar linkage with the support member <b>30</b> that permits relative pivotable movement between the row unit <b>20</b> and the associated tool frame <b>18</b>.

However, it should be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the disclosed system <b>100</b> may generally be utilized with seed planting implements having any other suitable implement configuration and/or seed planting units having any other suitable unit configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the system <b>100</b> may include a fluid-driven actuator, such as the actuator <b>102</b> of the row unit <b>20</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As shown, the actuator <b>102</b> may correspond to a hydraulic actuator. Thus, in several embodiments, the actuator <b>102</b> may include a piston <b>108</b> housed within the cylinder <b>106</b>. One end of the rod <b>104</b> may be coupled to the piston <b>108</b>, while an opposed end of the rod <b>104</b> may extend outwardly from the cylinder <b>106</b>. Additionally, the actuator <b>102</b> may include a cap-side chamber <b>110</b> and a rod-side chamber <b>112</b> defined within the cylinder <b>106</b>. As is generally understood, by regulating the pressure of the fluid supplied to one or both of the cylinder chambers <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, the actuation of the rod <b>104</b> may be controlled. However, it should be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, the actuator <b>102</b> may be configured as any other suitable type of actuator, such as a pneumatic actuator. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that, in further embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may include any other suitable number of fluid-driven actuators, such as additional actuators <b>102</b> mounted on the implement <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Furthermore, the system <b>100</b> may include various components configured to provide fluid (e.g., hydraulic oil) to the cylinder chambers <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> of the actuator <b>102</b>. For example, in several embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may include a fluid reservoir <b>114</b> and first and second fluid conduits <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>. As shown, a first fluid conduit <b>116</b> may extend between and fluidly couple the reservoir <b>114</b> and the rod-side chamber <b>112</b> of the actuator <b>102</b>. Similarly, a second fluid conduit <b>118</b> may extend between and fluidly couple the reservoir <b>114</b> and the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> of the actuator <b>102</b>. Additionally, a pump <b>115</b> and a remote switch <b>117</b> or other valve(s) may be configured to control the flow of the fluid between the reservoir <b>114</b> and the cylinder chambers <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> of the actuator <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, the reservoir <b>114</b>, the pump <b>115</b>, and the remote switch <b>117</b> may be mounted on the work vehicle (not shown) configured to tow the implement <b>10</b>. However, it should be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, the reservoir <b>114</b>, the pump <b>115</b>, and/or the remote switch <b>117</b> may be mounted on the implement <b>10</b>. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that the system <b>100</b> may include any other suit component(s) configured to control the flow of fluid between the reservoir and the actuator <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In several embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may also include a flow restrictor <b>120</b> that is fluidly coupled to the cap-side chamber <b>110</b>. As such, the flow restrictor <b>120</b> may be provided in series with the second fluid conduit <b>118</b>. As will be described below, the flow restrictor <b>120</b> may be configured to reduce the flow rate of the fluid exiting the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> in a manner that provides damping to one or more components of the implement <b>10</b>. However, it should be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, the flow restrictor <b>120</b> may be fluidly coupled to the rod-side chamber <b>120</b> such that the flow restrictor <b>120</b> is provided in series with the first fluid conduit <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additionally, in several embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may include a check valve <b>122</b> that is fluidly coupled to the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> and provided in series with the second fluid conduit <b>118</b>. As shown, the check valve <b>122</b> may be fluidly coupled to the flow restrictor <b>120</b> in parallel. In this regard, the check valve <b>122</b> may be provided in series with a first branch <b>124</b> of the second fluid conduit <b>118</b>, while the flow restrictor <b>120</b> may be provided in series with a second branch <b>126</b> of the second fluid conduit <b>118</b>. As such, the check valve <b>122</b> may be configured to allow the fluid to flow through the first branch <b>124</b> of the second fluid conduit <b>118</b> from the reservoir <b>114</b> to the cap-side chamber <b>110</b>. However, the check valve <b>122</b> may be configured to occlude or prevent the fluid from flowing through the first branch <b>124</b> of the second fluid conduit <b>118</b> from the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> to the reservoir <b>114</b>. In this regard, the check valve <b>122</b> directs all of the fluid exiting the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> into the flow restrictor <b>120</b>. Conversely, the check valve <b>122</b> permits the fluid flowing to the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> to bypass the flow restrictor <b>120</b>. As will be described below, such configuration facilitates damping of one or more components of the implement <b>10</b>. However, it should be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, the check valve <b>122</b> may be fluidly coupled to the rod-side chamber <b>112</b> in combination with the flow restrictor <b>120</b> such that the check valve <b>122</b> is provided in series with the first fluid conduit <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As indicated above, the system <b>100</b> may generally be configured to provide viscous damping to one or more components of the implement <b>10</b>. For example, when a ground engaging tool of the implement <b>10</b>, such as the shank <b>32</b>, contacts a rock or other impediment in the soil, the corresponding row unit <b>20</b> may pivot relative to the corresponding tool frame <b>18</b> and/or the toolbar <b>12</b> against the down pressure load applied to the row unit <b>20</b> by the corresponding actuator <b>102</b>. In several embodiments, such movement may cause the rod <b>104</b> of the actuator <b>102</b> to retract into the cylinder <b>106</b>, thereby moving the piston <b>108</b> in a manner that decreases the volume of the cap-side chamber <b>110</b>. In such instances, some of the fluid present within the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> may exit and flow into the second fluid conduit <b>118</b> toward the reservoir <b>114</b>. The check valve <b>122</b> may prevent the fluid exiting the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> from flowing through the first branch <b>124</b> of the second fluid conduit <b>118</b>. As such, all fluid exiting the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> may be directed into the second branch <b>126</b> and through the flow restrictor <b>120</b>. As indicated above, the flow restrictor <b>120</b> reduces or limits the rate at which the fluid may flow through the second fluid conduit <b>118</b> so as to reduce the rate at which the fluid may exit the cap-side chamber <b>110</b>. In this regard, the speed at which and/or the amount that the rod <b>104</b> retracts into the cylinder <b>106</b> when the shank <b>32</b> contacts a soil impediment may be reduced (e.g., because of the reduced rate at which the fluid is discharged from the cap-side chamber <b>110</b>), thereby damping the movement of the row unit <b>20</b> relative to the corresponding tool frame <b>18</b> and/or the toolbar <b>12</b>. Furthermore, after the initial retraction of the rod <b>104</b> into the cylinder <b>106</b>, the piston <b>108</b> may then move in a manner that increases the volume of the cap-side chamber <b>110</b>, thereby extending the rod <b>104</b> from the cylinder <b>106</b>. In such instances, fluid present within the reservoir <b>114</b> and the second fluid conduit <b>118</b> may be drawn back into the cap-side chamber <b>110</b>. As indicated above, the check valve <b>122</b> may permit the fluid within the second fluid conduit <b>118</b> to bypass the flow restrictor <b>120</b> and flow unobstructed through the first branch <b>124</b>, thereby maximizing the rate at which the fluid returns to the cap-side chamber <b>110</b>. Increasing the rate at which the fluid returns to the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> may decrease the time that the row unit <b>20</b> is displaced relative to the tool frame <b>18</b>, thereby further damping of the row unit <b>20</b> relative to the corresponding tool frame <b>18</b> and/or the toolbar <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a cross-sectional view of one embodiment of the flow restrictor <b>120</b> is illustrated in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the flow restrictor <b>120</b> may include a restrictor body <b>128</b> coupled to the second branch <b>126</b> of the second fluid conduit <b>118</b>, with the restrictor body <b>128</b>, in turn, defining a fluid passage <b>130</b> extending therethrough. Furthermore, the flow restrictor <b>120</b> may include an orifice plate <b>132</b> extending inward from the restrictor body <b>128</b> into the fluid passage <b>130</b>. As shown, the orifice plate <b>132</b> may define a central aperture or throat <b>134</b> extending therethrough. In general, the size (e.g., the area, diameter, etc.) of the throat <b>134</b> may be smaller than the size of the fluid passage <b>130</b> so as to reduce the flow rate of the fluid through the flow restrictor <b>120</b>. It should be appreciated that, in the illustrated embodiment, the throat <b>134</b> has a fixed size such that the throat <b>134</b> provides a fixed or constant backpressure for a given fluid flow rate. In this regard, in such embodiment, a fixed or constant damping rate is provided by the system <b>100</b>. However, it should be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, the flow restrictor <b>120</b> may have any other suitable configuration that reduces the flow rate of the fluid flowing therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a cross-sectional view of another embodiment of the flow restrictor <b>120</b> is illustrated in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter. As shown, the flow restrictor <b>120</b> may generally be configured the same as or similar to that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. For instance, the flow restrictor <b>120</b> may define the throat <b>134</b>, which is configured to reduce the flow rate of the fluid through the flow restrictor <b>120</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, unlike the above-describe embodiment, the size (e.g., the area, diameter, etc.) of the throat <b>134</b> is adjustable. For example, in such embodiment, the flow restrictor <b>120</b> may be configured as an adjustable valve <b>136</b>. As shown, the valve <b>136</b> may include a valve body <b>138</b> coupled to the second branch <b>126</b> of the second fluid conduit <b>118</b>, a shaft <b>140</b> rotatably coupled to the valve body <b>138</b>, a disc <b>142</b> coupled to the shaft <b>140</b>, and an actuator <b>144</b> (e.g., a suitable electric motor) coupled to the shaft <b>140</b>. As such, the actuator <b>144</b> may be configured to rotate the shaft <b>140</b> and the disc <b>142</b> relative to the valve body <b>138</b> (e.g., as indicated by arrow <b>146</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to change the size of the throat <b>134</b> defined between the disc <b>142</b> and the valve body <b>138</b>. Although the valve <b>136</b> is configured as a butterfly valve in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it should be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, the valve <b>136</b> may be configured as any other suitable type of valve or adjustable flow restrictor. For example, in one embodiment, the valve <b>136</b> may be configured as a suitable ball valve.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, by adjusting the size of the throat <b>134</b>, the system <b>100</b> may be able to provide variable damping rates. In general, the size of the throat <b>134</b> may be indicative of the amount of damping provided by the system <b>100</b>. For example, in several embodiments, the disc <b>142</b> may be adjustable between a first position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and a second position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. More specifically, when the disc <b>142</b> is at the first position, the throat <b>134</b> defines a first size (e.g., as indicated by arrow <b>148</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), thereby providing a first damping rate. Conversely, when the disc <b>142</b> is at the second position, the throat <b>134</b> defines a second size (e.g., as indicated by arrow <b>150</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), thereby providing a second damping rate. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the first distance <b>148</b> is larger than the second distance <b>150</b>. In such instance, the system <b>100</b> provides greater damping when the throat <b>134</b> is adjusted to the first size than when the throat <b>134</b> is adjusted to the second size. It should be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, the disc <b>142</b> may be adjustable between any other suitable positions that provide any other suitable damping rates. For example, the disc <b>142</b> may be adjustable to a plurality of different positions defined between the fully opened and fully closed positions of the valve, thereby providing for a corresponding number of different damping rates. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that the disc <b>142</b> may be continuously adjustable or adjustable between various discrete positions.</p>

Such control signals <b>166</b> may be configured to regulate the operation of the actuator <b>144</b> to adjust the position of the disc <b>142</b> relative to the valve body <b>138</b>, such as by moving the disc <b>142</b> along the direction <b>146</b> between the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). For example, the feedback signals <b>116</b> received by the controller <b>152</b> may be indicative that the operator desires to adjust the damping provided by the system <b>100</b>. Furthermore, upon receipt of the sensor data <b>164</b> (e.g., data indicative of the location and/or speed of the implement <b>10</b>), the controller <b>152</b> may be configured to determine that the damping rate of the system <b>100</b> should be adjusted. In either instance, the controller <b>152</b> may be configured to transmit the control signals <b>166</b> to the actuator <b>144</b>, with such control signals <b>166</b> being configured to control the operation of the actuator <b>144</b> to adjust the position of the disc <b>142</b> to provide the desired damping rate. However, it should be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, the controller <b>152</b> may be configured to control the operation of the valve <b>136</b> based on any other suitable input(s) and/or parameter(s).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a schematic view of another embodiment of the system <b>100</b> is illustrated in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter. As shown, the system <b>100</b> may generally be configured the same as or similar to that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. For instance, the system <b>100</b> may include the flow restrictor <b>120</b> and the check valve <b>122</b> fluidly coupled to the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> of the actuator <b>102</b> via the second fluid conduit <b>118</b>. Furthermore, the flow restrictor <b>120</b> and the check valve <b>122</b> may be fluidly coupled together in parallel. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, unlike the above-describe embodiment, the check valve <b>122</b> may be configured as a pilot-operated or fluid actuated three-way valve that is fluidly coupled to the first fluid conduit <b>116</b> by a pilot conduit <b>168</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In general, when the row unit <b>20</b> is lifted from an operational position relative to the ground to a raised position relative to the ground, it may be desirable for fluid to exit the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> without its flow rate being limited by the flow restrictor <b>120</b>. For example, permitting such fluid to bypass the flow restrictor <b>120</b> may reduce the time required to lift the row unit <b>20</b> from the operational position to the raised position. More specifically, when lifting the row unit <b>20</b> from the operational position to the raised position, a pump (not shown) may pump fluid through the first fluid conduit <b>116</b> from the reservoir <b>114</b> to the rod-side chamber <b>112</b> of the actuator <b>102</b>, thereby retracting the rod <b>104</b> into the cylinder <b>106</b>. This may, in turn, discharge fluid from the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> into the second fluid conduit <b>118</b>. As described above, the check valve <b>122</b> may generally be configured to direct all fluid exiting the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> into the flow restrictor <b>120</b>. However, in the configuration of the system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when lifting the row unit <b>20</b> to the raised position, the pilot conduit <b>168</b> supplies fluid flowing through the first fluid conduit <b>116</b> to the check valve <b>122</b>. The fluid received from the pilot conduit <b>168</b> may, in turn, actuate suitable component(s) of the check valve <b>122</b> (e.g., a diaphragm(s), a spring(s), and/or the like) in a manner that causes the check valve <b>122</b> to open, thereby permitting the fluid exiting the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> to bypass the flow restrictor <b>120</b> and flow unobstructed through the check valve <b>122</b> toward the reservoir <b>114</b>. Conversely, when the row unit <b>20</b> is at the operational position, the check valve <b>122</b> may be closed, thereby directing all fluid exiting the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> into the flow restrictor <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a schematic view of a further embodiment of the system <b>100</b> is illustrated in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter. As shown, the system <b>100</b> may generally be configured the same as or similar to that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 8</figref>. For instance, the system <b>100</b> may include the flow restrictor <b>120</b> and the check valve <b>122</b> fluidly coupled to the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> of the actuator <b>102</b> via the second fluid conduit <b>118</b>. Furthermore, the flow restrictor <b>120</b> and the check valve <b>122</b> may be fluidly coupled together in parallel. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, unlike the above-describe embodiments, the check valve <b>122</b> may be configured as an electrically actuated valve. Specifically, as shown, the controller <b>152</b> may be communicatively coupled to the check valve <b>122</b> via a wired or wireless connection to allow control signals (e.g., indicated by dashed lines <b>170</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) to be transmitted from the controller <b>152</b> to the check valve <b>122</b>. In this regard, when the row unit <b>20</b> is lifted from the operational position to the raised position, the control signals <b>170</b> may be configured to instruct the check valve <b>122</b> to open in a manner that permits the fluid exiting the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> to bypass the flow restrictor <b>120</b> and flow unobstructed through the check valve <b>122</b> toward the reservoir <b>114</b>. Conversely, when the row unit <b>20</b> is at the operational position, the control signals <b>170</b> may be configured to instruct the check valve <b>122</b> to close, thereby directing all fluid exiting the cap-side chamber <b>110</b> into the flow restrictor <b>120</b>.</p>
