PAC  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
PAR  1. Field of the Invention
PAR  The present invention relates to a labeled complex for microassay using
      near-infrared radiation. More specifically, the present invention relates
      to a labeled complex capable of specifically detecting a certain
      particular component in a complex mixture with a higher sensitivity.
PAR  2. Related Background Art
PAR  On irradiating a laser beam on a trace substance labeled with dyes and the
      like, information due to the substance is generated such as scattered
      light, absorption light, fluorescent light and furthermore light
      acoustics. It is widely known in the field of analysis using lasers, to
      detect such information so as to practice microassays rapidly with a
      higher precision.
PAR  A gas laser represented by an argon laser and a helium laser has
      conventionally been used exclusively as a laser source. In recent years,
      however, a semi-conductor laser has been developed, and based on the
      characteristic features thereof such as inexpensive cost, small scale and
      easy output control, it is now desired to use the semiconductor laser as a
      light source.
PAR  If diagnostically useful substances from living organisms are assayed by
      means of the wave-length in ultraviolet and visible regions as has
      conventionally been used, the background (blank) via the intrinsic
      fluorescence of naturally occurring products, such as flavin, pyridine
      coenzyme and serum proteins, which are generally contained in samples, is
      likely to increase. Only if a light source in a near-infrared region can
      be used, such background from naturally occurring products can be
      eliminated so that the sensitivity to substances to be measured might be
      enhanced, consequently.
PAR  However, the oscillation wavelength of a semiconductor laser is generally
      in red and near-infrared regions (670 to 830 nm), where not too many dyes
      generate fluorescence via absorption or excitation. A representative
      example of such dyes is polymethine-type dye having a longer conjugated
      chain. Examples of labeling substances from living organisms with a
      polymethine-type dye and using the labeled substances for microanalysis
      are reported by K. Sauda, T. Imasaka, et al. in the report in Anal. Chem.,
      58, 2649-2653 (1986), such that plasma protein is labeled with a cyanine
      dye having a sulfonate group (for example, Indocyanine Green) for the
      analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography.
PAR  Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2-191674 discloses that various
      cyanine dyes having sulfonic acid groups or sulfonate groups are used for
      labeling substances from living organisms and for detecting the
      fluorescence.
PAR  However, these known cyanine dyes emitting fluorescence via absorption or
      excitation in the near-infrared region are generally not particularly
      stable under light or heat.
PAR  If the dyes are used as labeling agents and bonded to substances from
      living organisms such as antibodies for preparing complexes, the complexes
      are likely to be oxidized easily by environmental factors such as light,
      heat, moisture, atmospheric oxygen and the like or to be subjected to
      modification such as generating cross-links. Particularly in water, a
      modification such as hydrolysis is further accelerated, disadvantageously.
      Therefore, the practical use of these complexes as detecting reagents in
      carrying out the microassay of the components of living organisms has
      encountered difficulties because of their poor stability under storage.
PAC  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
PAR  The present inventors have made various investigations so as to solve the
      above problems, and have found that a dye of a particular structure, more
      specifically a particular polymethine dye, and among others, a dye having
      an azulene skelton, are extremely stable even after the immobilization
      thereof as a labeling agent onto substances from living organisms. Thus,
      the inventors have achieved the present invention. It is an object of the
      present invention to provide a labeled complex with excellent storage
      stability which can overcome the above problems.

      labeled complex for detecting a subject compound to be analyzed by means

PAR  These illustrated labeling agents absorb light in a near-infrared
      wavelength region of 670 to 900 nm, and the molar absorption coefficient e
      is in the region of 50,000 to 300,000 1/mol.cm. Some of the illustrated
      labeling agents generate intense fluorescence.
PAR  The dye No. 30 illustrated in Table 5 exhibits the maximum absorption at a
      wavelength of 819 nm in a near-infrared region and emits fluorescence. The
      maximum fluorescence wavelength (.lambda.em) is 864 nm (medium;
      dichloromethane).
PAR  In accordance with the present invention, the labeling agents described
      above are immobilized onto a substance from a living organism, but the
      substance from a living organism to be immobilized is selectively
      determined based on a substance to be analyzed or a subject sample. That
      is, if a substance is selected from a living organism having a biological
      specificity to a subject sample, the substance to be analyzed can be
      detected with specificity. By the term "substance from a living organism"
      is meant naturally occurring or synthetic peptides, proteins, enzymes,
      sugars, rectins, viruses, bacteria, nucleic acids, DNA, RNA, antigens
      (including for example recombinant antigens), antibodies and the like. The
      substances specifically useful in terms of clinical pathology include the
      following; immunoglobulin such as IgG, IgM, IgE and the like; plasma
      proteins and antibodies thereof, such as compliments, CRP, ferritin,
      .alpha.1-microglobulin, .beta.2-microglobulin, and the like; tumor markers
      and antibodies thereof, such as .alpha.-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic
      antigen (CEA), prostate acid phosphatase (PAP), CA19-9, CA-125 and the
      like; hormones and antibodies thereof such as luteinizing hormone (LH),
      follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG),
      estrogen, insulin and the like; substances in relation with virus
      infection and antibodies thereof, such as HBV-related antigens (HBs, HBe,
      HBc), HIV, ATL and the like; bacteria and antibodies thereof, such as
      Corynebacterium diphteriae, Clostridium botulinum, mycoplasma, Treponema
      pallidum and the like; protozoae and antibodies thereof such as Toxoplasma
      gondii, Trichomonas, Leishmania, Tripanozoma, malaria protozoa and the
      like; pharmaceutical agents and antibodies thereof, such as antileptic
      agents including phenytoin, phenobarbital and the like, cardiovascular
      agents including quinidine and digoxin, antasthmatic agents including
      theophylline, antibiotics including chloramphenicol and gentamycin; as
      well as, enzymes, enterotoxin (streptolysin O) and the antibodies thereof.
      Depending on the type of sample, a substance which can incur the
      antigen-antibody reaction with a substance to be measured in a sample is
      appropriately selected for use.
PAR  In accordance with the present invention, the following known method can be
      utilized in order to immobilize a labeling agent onto a substance from a
      living organism such as a physiological active substance.
PAR  There are illustrated for example i) ion bonding method, ii) physical
      absorption method, iii) covalent bonding method and the like.
PAR  The ion bonding method comprises electrostatically bonding a labelling
      agent having principally a positive charge to a substance from a living
      organism such as proteins, DNA, RNA and the like.
PAR  The physical absorption method comprises utilizing the hydrophobic bond
      between the lipophilic part of a labeling agent and the lipophilic part of
      a protein.
PAR  The reaction process of bonding is simple in accordance with the ion
      bonding method and physical absorption method, but the bonding strength of
      a labeling agent and a substance from a living organism is weak.
PAR  On contrast, the covalent bonding method comprises bonding a highly
      reactive functional group to at least one of a labeling agent and a
      substance from a living organism, and covalently bonding the two through
      the functional group whereby a highly intense bonding strength can be
      generated. In bonding a labeling agent with a substance from a living
      organism such as physiological active substances via covalent bonds, the
      functional groups being present in the substance from a living organism
      and which can be involved in the bonding, include free amino group,
      hydroxyl group, phosphate group, carboxyl group, the sulfhydryl group of
      cysteine, the imidazole group of histidine, phenol group of tyrosine, the
      hydroxyl group of serine and threonine, and the like.
PAR  These functional groups react with a variety of diazonium salts, acid
      amides, isocyanate, active-type halogenated alkyl groups, active-type
      ester groups and the like. Therefore, by a variety of methods, dyes can be
      immobilized onto a substance from a living organism by introducing these
      functional groups into a labeling agent. Alternatively, the conformation
      of a substance from a living organism, specifically that of proteins, is
      readily damaged because it is retained through relatively weak bonds such
      as hydrogen bond, hydrophobic bond, ion bond and the like. Thus, the
      immobilization with a labeling agent preferably should be carried out
      under mild conditions, without processing by means of high temperatures,
      strong acids and strong alkalis.
PAR  One method of carrying out the immobilization under mild conditions
      includes the use of bifunctional cross-linking agents which react with a
      labeling agent and with the functional groups of a substance from a living
      organism. The bifunctional cross-linking agents include, for example,
      carbodiimide represented by the general formula R--N.dbd.C.dbd.N--R',
      dialdehyde represented by the general formula CHO--R--CHO, diisocyanate
      represented by O.dbd.C.dbd.N--R--N.dbd.C.dbd.O (wherein R and R' represent
      individually the same or a different substituted or unsubstituted alkyl
      group, aryl group alkylaryl group or aryl alkyl group), and the like.
PAR  The analysis of a certain particular objective substance is conducted by
      using the resulting labeled complex in which a labeling agent is
      immobilized onto a substance from a living organism.
PAR  If a target (analytical subject) is one species of cell, the labeled
      complex is bonded to a specific substance on the cell complimentary to the
      substance from a living organism bonded to the labeled complex via a
      specific bonding such as an antigen-antibody reaction or the hydrogen
      bonding between nucleic acids. Then, the amount of such antigen, antibody
      or nucleic acids can be measured based on the fluorescence or absorbance
      of the system.
PAR  If the analysis is effected of a target in relation with an antigen and an
      antibody, a complex bonded through the labeling agent to an antigen (or an
      antibody) and an antibody (an antigen if a labeling agent is immobilized
      onto the antibody) to be measured are subjected to antigen-antibody
      reaction. The complex (B; bonded type) bonded to the antibody (antigen) is
      then separated from the complex (F; free type) which is not bonded to the
      antibody (antigen) (B/F separation). Thereafter, the amount of the complex
      (B) is determined based on the fluorescence or absorbance. The technique
      utilizing the antigen-antibody reaction described above is described in
      details in "Examination and Technology", Vol. 16, No. 7 (1988).
PAR  In terms of detection sensitivity, furthermore, it is preferable that two
      or more, preferably 10 or more labeling agents are bonded to one molecule
      of a substance from a living organism. In terms of synthesis and
      sensitivity, preferably 10 to 100, more preferably 20 to 50 such agents
      may be bonded to one molecule thereof.
PAR  The present invention will now be explained with reference to examples.
PAC  EXAMPLE 1
PAR  Anti-human CRP sheep serum (IgG fraction; manufactured by Cooper Biomedical
      Inc.) was diluted with phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, to a concentration of 0.5
      mg/ml, to prepare an antibody solution. To 8 ml of the antibody solution
      were added 0.2 mg of a labeling agent No. 3 of Table 1 (.lambda.max=833
      nm) and 0.09 g of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide
      hydrochloride (referred to as WSC hereinafter) (manufactured by Dojin
      Chemicals, Co. Ltd.) for reaction at room temperature for three hours, to
      generate a labeling agent-antibody complex. The labeling agent-antibody
      complex was separated and purified from unreacted substances by gel
      filtration chromatography on a column packed with Sepharose 6B. The
      bonding molar ratio of the labeling agent and the antibody in the complex
      thus obtained was 2.1:1. By using a spectrophotometer Shimadzu UV-3100S,
      the absorbance of the complex was measured at wavelengths .lambda.=833 nm
      and .lambda.=280 nm, separately, to calculate the molar ratio of the
      labeling agent and the antibody.

PAR  With 10 ml of the rectin solution was reacted 0.2 mg of a labeling agent
      No. 6 of Table 1 (.lambda.max=825 nm) at room temperature for three hours.
      The labeling agent-rectin complex was separated and purified on a gel
      filtration chromatocolumn packed with Sepharose 6B. The molar ratio of the
      labeling agent and the rectin in the complex obtained was 3.7:1. The
      absorbances at wavelengths .lambda.=825 and .lambda.=280 nm were measured
      by a spectrophotometer Shimadzu UV-3100S, to calculate the molar ratio of
      the labeling agent and the rectin.

PAR  To 8 ml of the antibody solution was added 0.3 mg of a labeling agent No.
      12 of Table 1 (.lambda.max=705 nm) for agitation at room temperature for
      three hours. The labeling agent-antibody complex was separated and
      purified by gel filtration chromatography on a column packed with
      Sepharose 6B.
PAR  The molar ratio of the labeling agent and the antibody in the labeling
      agent-antibody complex thus obtained was 1.7:1. By using a
      spectrophotometer 1 Shimadzu UV-3100S, the absorbance of the complex was
      measured at wavelengths .lambda.=705 nm and .lambda.=280 nm, separately,
      to calculate the molar ratio of the labeling agent and the antibody.
PAC  EXAMPLE 4
PAR  M13mp18 single-strand DNA (7249 bases) (manufactured by TAKARA Liquor KK.)
      (0.1 mg) was diluted with 5 mmol phosphate buffer, pH 6, to prepare a DNA
      solution. A labeling agent No. 5 (0.1 mg) shown in Table 1
      (.lambda.max=796 nm) was dissolved in 5 ml of distilled water, and
      subsequently, 5 ml of the DNA solution was gradually added dropwise to the
      resulting dye solution. Agitation was further effected at room temperature
      for 2 hours, to produce a DNA-labeling agent complex.
PAR  To the solution of the DNA-labeling agent complex described above was added
      further 40 ml of ethanol, to precipitate the DNA-labeling agent complex.
      The DNA-labeling agent complex was separated on a filter, followed by
      washing with ethanol. The DNA-labeling agent complex after the washing was
      again dissolved in 2 ml of the phosphate buffer, pH 6. The amount of the
      labeling agent bonded to that of the DNA was 0.5 .mu.g per .mu.g.DNA. The
      absorbance of the complex was measured at wavelengths .lambda.=705 nm and
      .lambda.=280 nm, separately, to calculate the concentrations of the
      labeling agent and the DNA.
PAC  EXAMPLE 5
PAR  A 20-mer oligonucleotide having a base sequence partially complimentary to
      the base sequence of a model target nucleic acid M13mp18 ss DNA was
      synthesized by a DNA synthesizer 381 A, manufactured by ABI Co. Ltd. Then,
      a primary amine was introduced into the 5' terminus of the oligonucleotide
      by using a N-MMT-hexanol amine linker manufactured by Milligen Co. Ltd.,
      instead of general amidide reagents. A predetermined protocol was followed
      to perform cutting out from the CPG-support, deprotection (including the
      deprotection of monomethoxytrityl group as a protective group of the
      primary amine), and the purification by high-performance liquid
      chromatography.
PAR  After mixing together 200 .mu.g of the oligonucleotide, 100 .mu.l of 1M
      sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.0, and 700 .mu.l of water, 2 mg of a
      labeling agent No. 27 (.lambda.max=826 nm) shown in Table 1, which had
      preliminarily been dissolved in 200 .mu.l of dimethyl formamide, was
      gradually added under agitation. After the reaction at room temperature
      for 24 hours, the peak of the nucleic acid was decreased on a
      high-performance liquid chromatogram, whereas a new peak having the
      absorbances of the nucleic acid and the labeling agent developed. Thus,
      the reaction solution was nearly purified on a gel filtration column,
      NAP-50, manufactured by Pharmacia, which was then purified by HPLC to
      obtain 175 .mu.g of the nucleic acid-labeling agent complex.

PAR  To 5 ml of the antibody solution prepared in Example 1 was added 0.3 mg of
      the cyanine dye, and agitated at room temperature for 3 hours, to generate
      a labeling agent-antibody complex.
PAR  The labeling agent-antibody complex was separated and purified by gel
      filtration chromatography on a column packed with Sepharose 6B.
PAR  The molar ratio of the labeling agent and the antibody was 1.7:1. The
      absorbances at wavelength p=747 nm and p=280 nm were measured by a
      spectrophotometer Shimadzu UV-3100S to calculate the molar ratio of the
      labeling agent and the antibody. Complex stability under storage
PAR  In order to examine the complex stability under storage, the following
      experiments were carried out.
PAR  The labeled complexes prepared in Examples 1 to 5 and Comparative Example 1
      were prepared to predetermined concentrations with 10 mmol phosphate
      buffer, pH 7.2. The solutions of the labeled complexes were kept in dark
      at 7.degree. C. for three days. At the initiation and termination of the
      test of complex stability under storage, the absorbance was measured at
      predetermined wavelengths to calculate the ratio of the absorbance at the
      termination, provided that the absorbance at the initiation was designated
      as 100.
PAR  For the complexes exhibiting fluorescence, the ratio of the fluorescence
      intensity at the termination was calculated, provided that the
      fluorescence intensity at the initiation was designated as 100.

PAR  A 20-mer oligonucleotide having a base sequence partially complimentary to
      the base sequence of a model target nucleic acid M13mp18 ss DNA was

      ##STR98##
      with an amino group introduced, instead of general amidide reagents, 20
      such deoxyuridylic acid derivatives each having a primary amine group were
      added to the 5' terminus of the oligonucleotide. Routine method was
      followed to perform cutting out from the CPG-support, deprotection
      (including the deprotection of trifluoroacetyl group as a protective group
      of the primary amine), and the purification by high-performance liquid
      chromatography.
PAR  After mixing together 200 .mu.g of the oligonucleotide bonding the primary
      amines, 100 .mu.l of 1M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.0, and 700 .mu.l of
      water, 5 mg of a dye No. 27 (.lambda.max=826 nm) shown in Table 1, which
      had preliminarily been dissolved in 200 .mu.l of dimethyl formamide, was
      gradually added under agitation. After the reaction at 40.degree. C. for
      24 hours, the peak of the nucleic acid was decreased on a high-performance
      liquid chromatogram, whereas a new peak having the absorbances of the
      nucleic acid and the labeling agent developed. Thus, the reaction solution
      was nearly purified on a gel filtration column, NAP-50, manufactured by
      Pharmacia, which was then purified by HPLC to obtain 350 .mu.g of the
      nucleic acid-labeling agent complex. The absorbance of the nucleic
      acid-labeling agent complex at 826 nm had the intensity about 20-fold that
      of the nucleic acid-labeling agent shown in Example 5.
PAR  In accordance with the present invention, a stable complex can be formed
      with less decomposition of dyes, and hence with less change in absorbance
      or with less change in fluorescence, by bonding a labeling agent of a
      particular structure to a substance from a living organism.
