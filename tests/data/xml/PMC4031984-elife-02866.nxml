eukaryotes. To search for related machinery, we developed a structure-based bioinformatics tool, and identified the core subunits of TSET, a 'missing link' between the APs and COPI. Studies in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> indicate that TSET is a heterohexamer, with two associated scaffolding proteins. TSET is non-essential in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, but may act in plasma membrane turnover, and is essentially identical to the recently described TPLATE complex, TPC. However, whereas TPC was reported to be plant-specific, we can identify a full or partial complex in every eukaryotic supergroup. An evolutionary path can be deduced from the earliest origins of the heterotetramer/scaffold coat to its multiple manifestations in modern organisms, including the mammalian muniscins, descendants of the TSET medium subunits. Thus, we have uncovered the machinery for an ancient and widespread pathway, which provides new insights into early eukaryotic evolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

The defining feature of eukaryotes is that, unlike nearly all bacteria, they have membrane-bound compartments&#x02014;such as the nucleus&#x02014;within their cells.</p><p>Moving molecules, such as proteins, between these compartments is essential for living eukaryotic cells, and these molecules are usually trafficked inside membrane-bound packages called vesicles. Two similar sets of protein complexes&#x02014;each containing four different subunits&#x02014;ensure that the molecules are packaged inside the correct vesicles. However, it is not clear how these two protein complexes (called the AP complexes and the COPI complex) are related to each other, and when and where they originated in the history of life.</p><p>Now, Hirst, Schlacht et al. have discovered a new&#x02014;but very ancient&#x02013;protein complex that they refer to as the &#x02018;missing link&#x02019; between the AP and COPI complexes. The four subunits inside this new complex were found by searching for proteins with shapes that were similar to those of the AP and COPI proteins, rather than just searching for proteins with similar sequences of amino acids. This approach identified related protein subunits in groups as diverse as plants and slime moulds, which suggests that this protein complex evolved in the earliest of the eukaryotes. The four subunits identified in a slime mould were confirmed to interact, and also shown to bind to the plasma membrane of living cells.</p><p>One of the subunits had already been named TPLATE, so Hirst, Schlacht et al. decided to call the complex TSET; the other three subunits were named TSAUCER, TCUP and TSPOON, and two other proteins that interacted with the complex were both called TTRAY.</p><p>While most of the TSET complex itself has been lost from humans and other animals, one of subunit appears to have evolved into a family of proteins that help molecules get into cells. The discovery of TSET reveals another major player in vesicle-trafficking that is not only important for our understanding of how modern eukaryotes work, but also how ancient eukaryotes evolved.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

Key to this transition was the ability to generate intracellular membrane compartments and the trafficking pathways that interconnect them, mediated in part by the heterotetrameric adaptor complexes, APs 1&#x02013;5 and COPI (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dacks et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Field and Dacks, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hirst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koumandou et al., 2013</xref>). In mammals, APs 1 and 2 and COPI are essential for viability, while mutations in the other APs cause severe genetic disorders (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Boehm and Bonifacino, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hirst et al., 2013</xref>). The AP and COPI complexes share a similar architecture, due to common ancestry predating the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). All six complexes consist of two large subunits of &#x0223c;100 kD, a medium subunit of &#x0223c;50 kD, and a small subunit of &#x0223c;20 kD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Their function is to select cargo for packaging into transport vesicles, and together with membrane-deforming scaffolding proteins such as clathrin and the COPI B-subcomplex, they facilitate the trafficking of proteins and lipids between membrane compartments in the secretory and endocytic pathways. The recent discovery of the evolutionarily ancient AP-5 complex, found on late endosomes and lysosomes, added a new dimension to models of the endomembrane system, and raised the possibility that other undetected membrane-trafficking complexes might exist (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hirst et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we set out in search of additional members of the AP/COPI subunit families.<fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02866.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Diagrams of APs and F-COPI.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structures of the assembled complexes. All six complexes are heterotetramers; the individual subunits are called adaptins in the APs (e.g., &#x003b3;-adaptin) and COPs in COPI (e.g., &#x003b3;-COP). The two large subunits in each complex are structurally similar to each other. They are arranged with their N-terminal domains in the core of the complex, and these domains are usually (but not always) followed by a flexible linker and an appendage domain. The medium subunits consist of an N-terminal longin-related domain followed by a C-terminal &#x003bc; homology domain (MHD). The small subunits consist of a longin-related domain only.

As proof of principle, we used this database to identify all four subunits of the AP-5 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data SD2-data">Figure 1&#x02014;source data 1, 2</xref>), even though in our previous study only the medium subunit was initially detectable by bioinformatics-based searching (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hirst et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition to known proteins, our reverse HHpred database revealed novel candidates for each of the four subunit families, with orthologues present in diverse eukaryotes including plants and <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2 fig1s3 fig1s4">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplements 2&#x02013;4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data SD2-data">Figure 1&#x02014;source data 1, 2</xref>). Secondary structure predictions confirmed that the new family members have similar folds to their counterparts in the AP complexes and COPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Only one of these proteins had been characterised functionally: TPLATE (NP_186827.2), an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protein related to the AP &#x003b2; subunits and &#x003b2;-COP, found in a microscopy-based screen for proteins involved in mitosis and localised to the cell plate (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Van Damme et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Van Damme et al., 2011</xref>). There is some variability between orthologous subunits in different organisms: for instance, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has added an SH3 domain to the C-terminal end of its &#x02018;&#x003b3;&#x003b1;&#x003b4;&#x003b5;&#x003b6;&#x02019; large subunit, while <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> has lost the &#x003bc; homology domain (MHD) at the end of its medium subunit; and in general there seems to be much less selective pressure on these genes than on those encoding other AP/COPI family members (e.g., the AP-1 &#x003b2;1 subunits are 58.01% identical in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, while the new &#x003b2; family members are only 14.63% identical).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TSET: a new trafficking complex</title><p>To determine whether the four new candidate subunits identified in our searches actually form a complex, we transformed <italic>D. discoideum</italic> with a GFP-tagged version of its small (&#x003c3;-like) subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and then used anti-GFP to immunoprecipitate the construct and any associated proteins from cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Both proteins are predicted to consist of two N-terminal &#x003b2;-propeller domains followed by an &#x003b1;-solenoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 1C</xref>). This type of architecture is found in several coat components, including clathrin heavy chain, SPG11 (associated with AP-5), the &#x003b1;-COP and &#x003b2;&#x02032;-COP subunits of the COPI coat (B-COPI), and the Sec31 subunit of the COPII coat (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Devos et al., 2004</xref>). HHpred analyses show that the closest matches for both XP_642289.1 and XP_637150.1 are &#x003b2;'-COP, followed by &#x003b1;-COP. Probable orthologues of XP_642289.1 and XP_637150.1 can be found in other organisms that have the four core subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 4</xref>). Because proteins with this architecture often act as a coat for transport vesicles, we hypothesize that these proteins may provide a scaffold for the newly identified heterotetramer.</p><p>The other three proteins in the immunoprecipitate, secG and vacuolins A and B, appear to be less widespread taxonomically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2 fig2s3">Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 2 and 3</xref>), but are nonetheless suggestive of function. SecG is related to the plasma membrane- and endosome-associated ARNO/cytohesin family of Arf GEFs in animal cells (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Shina et al., 2010</xref>), and also appears to be equimolar with the core complex. Vacuolins are members of the SPFH (stomatin-prohibitin-flotillin-HflC/K) superfamily. They have been shown to associate with the late vacuole just before exocytosis and also with the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Rauchenberger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gotthardt et al., 2002</xref>), and to contribute to vacuole function (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jenne et al., 1998</xref>). However, the amounts of coprecipitating vacuolins were more variable, suggesting that they are less tightly associated with the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, like TPLATE, both SecG and the vacuolins have been implicated in membrane traffic, acting at the plasma membrane and/or endosomal compartments.</p><p>As the &#x003b2;-like subunit is already named TPLATE, we propose similar nomenclature for the other three subunits of the heterotetramer, relating to their relative sizes: TSAUCER, TCUP, and TSPOON. For the two associated &#x003b2;-propeller/&#x003b1;-solenoid proteins, we propose TTRAY1 and TTRAY2, and for the conserved heterohexamer, we propose the name TSET.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Characterisation of the TSET complex in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic></title><p>One of the key properties of coat proteins is their ability to cycle on and off membranes. Although by widefield fluorescence microscopy TSPOON-GFP looked diffuse and cytosolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2&#x02014;figure supplement 1B</xref>), TIRF imaging showed a punctate pattern, especially in the cells with lower expression, indicating that some of the construct is associated with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

Uptake of FITC-dextran, an assay for fluid phase endocytosis, was unimpaired in the TSPOON knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>); however, uptake of FM1-43, a membrane marker, was slower than in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> shows the time taken to internalise the entire surface area), indicating that TSET plays a role in plasma membrane turnover, consistent with studies on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.

This provided moderate support for TSET as a clade, but strong resolution excluding it from the APs and COPI, as well as backbone resolution between the heterotetramer clades. Thus, TSET is clearly an ancient component of the eukaryotic membrane-trafficking system, distinct from the known heterotetramers.<fig id="fig4" position="float" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02866.020</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Evolution of TSET.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simplified diagram of the concatenated tree for TSET, APs, and COPI, based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4&#x02014;figure supplement 8</xref>.

(<bold>C</bold>) Possible evolution of the three families of heterotetramers: TSET, APs, and COPI. We propose that the earliest ancestral complex was a likely a heterotrimer or a heterohexamer formed from two identical heterotrimers, containing large (red), small (yellow), and scaffolding (blue) subunits. All three of these proteins were composed of known ancient building blocks of the membrane-trafficking system (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Vedovato et al., 2009</xref>): &#x003b1;-solenoid domains in both the large and scaffolding subunits; two &#x003b2;-propellers in the scaffolding subunit; and a longin domain forming the small subunit. The gene encoding the large subunit then duplicated and mutated to generate the two distinct types of large subunits (red and magenta), and the gene encoding the small subunit also duplicated and mutated (yellow and orange), with one of the two proteins (orange) acquiring a &#x003bc; homology domain (MHD) to form the ancestral heterotetramer, as proposed by Boehm and Bonifacino (12). However, the scaffolding subunit remained a homodimer. Upon diversification into three separate families, the scaffolding subunit duplicated independently in TSET and COPI, giving rise to TTRAY1 and TTRAY2 in TSET, and to &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;&#x02032;-COP in COPI. COPI also acquired a new subunit, &#x003b5;-COP (purple). The scaffolding subunit may have been lost in the ancestral AP complex, as indicated in the diagram; however, AP-5 is tightly associated with two other proteins, SPG11 and SPG15, and the relationship of SPG11 and SPG15 to TTRAY/B-COPI remains unresolved, so it is possible that SPG11 and SPG15 are highly divergent descendants of the original scaffolding subunits. The other AP complexes are free heterotetramers when in the cytosol, but membrane-associated AP-1 and AP-2 interact with another scaffold, clathrin; and AP-3 has also been proposed to interact transiently with a protein with similar architecture, Vps41 (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Rehling et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cabrera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Asensio et al., 2013</xref>). So far no scaffold has been proposed for AP-4. Although the order of emergence of TSET and COP relative to adaptins is unresolved, our most recent analyses indicate that, contrary to previous reports (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hirst et al., 2011</xref>), AP-5 diverged basally within the adaptin clade, followed by AP-3, AP-4, and APs 1 and 2, all prior to the LECA. This still suggests a primordial bridging of the secretory and phagocytic systems prior to emergence of a <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network. The muniscins arose much later, in ancestral opisthokonts, from a translocation of the TSET MHD-encoding sequence to a position immediately downstream from an F-BAR domain-encoding sequence. Another translocation occurred in plants, where an SH3 domain-coding sequence was inserted at the 3&#x02032; end of the TSAUCER-coding sequence.

Together, these findings imply that the ancestor of the TSET, COPI, and AP complexes was a heterohexamer rather than a heterotetramer, consisting of five different proteins, with the two scaffolding proteins present as two identical copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). These scaffolding subunits then duplicated independently in COPI and TSET. The ancestral AP complex may have lost its original scaffolding subunits, although AP-5, the first AP to branch away, is closely associated with SPG11, a &#x003b2;-propeller + &#x003b1;-solenoid protein whose relationship to the TTRAYs and B-COPI is as yet unclear. None of the other APs has any closely associated proteins with this architecture, but AP-1 and AP-2 transiently interact with clathrin, and there may also be a transient association between AP-3 and another &#x003b2;-propeller + &#x003b1;-solenoid protein, Vps41 (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Rehling et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cabrera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Asensio et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although TSET is deduced to have been present in LECA, the complex appears to have been entirely or partially lost in various lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). None of the subunits has a full orthologue in opisthokonts (animals and fungi), indicating secondary loss in the line leading to humans. However, the C-terminal domain of TCUP is homologous to the C-terminal domains of the muniscins, opisthokont-specific proteins (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Gadeyne et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">Figure 4&#x02014;figure supplement 10</xref>). This suggests that in opisthokonts, the TCUP gene retained its 3&#x02032; end, which then combined with a new 5&#x02032; end encoding an F-BAR domain to generate the muniscin family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These include the vertebrate proteins FCHo1/2 and the yeast protein Syp1, important players in the endocytic pathway (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Reider et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Henne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Umasankar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mayers et al., 2013</xref>). The muniscins constitute one of eight families of MHD proteins in humans, and the only family whose evolutionary origin was unexplained until now. The present study indicates not only that the muniscins are homologous to TCUP, but also that they are the sole surviving remnants of the full TSET complex that existed in our pre-opisthokont ancestors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>TSET is the latest addition to a growing set of trafficking proteins that have ancient distributions, but are frequently lost (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Schlacht et al., 2014</xref>), or in the case of TSET reduced perhaps with neofunctionalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This is consistent with the uneven distribution of the individual components (in contrast to the all-or-nothing distribution of AP-5), the additional apparently lineage-specific binding partners in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, and the acquisition of extra domains (e.g., F-BAR in opisthokonts and SH3 in plants) adding lineage-specific function.</p><p>Studies on the muniscins may help to explain the different phenotypes of TSET knockouts in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Like <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> TSET, the muniscins interact with EH domain-containing proteins and participate in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Reider et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Henne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Umasankar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mayers et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> has lost its TCUP MHD, and it seems likely that concomitant with this loss, it also lost some of TSET's binding partners and functions. Nevertheless, we suspect that TSET may predate clathrin-mediated endocytosis, for two reasons. First, AP-1 and AP-2, the two AP complexes that function together with clathrin, are the most recent additions to the AP family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>); and second, TSET already has its own &#x003b2;-propeller + &#x003b1;-solenoid scaffold, so it is not clear why it would need clathrin as well. Thus, the interaction between TSET and the clathrin pathway may have evolved considerably later than TSET itself, although still pre-LECA. It is tempting to speculate that TSET was part of the original endocytic machinery, which then became redundant in some organisms as the clathrin pathway took over.</p><p>Thus, our bioinformatics tool, reverse HHpred, is able to find novel homologues of known proteins, and could potentially be used to identify new players both in membrane traffic and in other pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 5</xref>). Using this tool, we were able to find the four core subunits of an ancient complex belonging to the same family as the APs and COPI. This ancient complex, TSET, is therefore both the answer to the question of the origin of the last set of MHD proteins in humans, and a major new piece of the puzzle to be incorporated alongside the other membrane-trafficking machinery, as we delve into the history of the eukaryotic cell.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Construction of the &#x02018;reverse HHpred&#x02019; database</title><p>The proteomes of various organisms (detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 2</xref>) were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information archives at <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/</ext-link>.

Each of the faa files was then compared to the pdb70 databank using the hhsearch program from the above suite. The files were tested using the default parameters. Once each protein sequence was tested, the output file was parsed and the hits were extracted and then inserted into a mysql database. The database is searchable by keywords in PDB entries, and therefore is limited to searches where the structure of a given domain structure has been solved. The database is accessible using the link <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://reversehhpred.cimr.cam.ac.uk/">http://reversehhpred.cimr.cam.ac.uk</ext-link>, and searches can be initiated using keywords.

Therefore, we were able to combine searches for novel large subunits, or for medium/small subunits. Using the key words &#x02018;clathrin&#x02019;, &#x02018;adaptor&#x02019;, &#x02018;adapter&#x02019;, &#x02018;adaptin&#x02019;, &#x02018;AP1&#x02019;, &#x02018;AP2&#x02019;, &#x02018;AP3&#x02019;, &#x02018;AP4&#x02019;, we searched in PDB for solved structures of any large or medium/small subunit in a given organism (11 solved structures for the large subunits and six solved structures for the medium/small subunits were used to initiate searches [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1&#x02014;figure supplement 1</xref>]). These structures span different domains found within the subunits. For each search, a list was output of any proteins found to contain structural homology. Included in this information are the precise amino acids encompassing the region of similarity, the probability score, and most importantly the &#x02018;result number&#x02019;. A protein with a &#x02018;result number&#x02019; of &#x02018;1&#x02019; means that there was no other structure in the PDB database that it is more like. Since multiple structures for the various subunits were used, we could also factor in the number of times a particular protein was identified in a search (&#x02018;repeats&#x02019;). These parameters were used as key pieces of evidence to determine how likely a hit in these searches would be. Once the primary data were outputted, all other manipulations were performed in Excel. For the large subunits there were 11 data sets (the 11 structures used to search for homologues), and for the medium/small subunits there were six data sets. The data manipulation was standardised at this point, and the following steps performed to assimilate the data. The data sets were sorted by result number to preclude anything with a result number of &#x0003e;50 (this means that there are 49 other structures in the PDB database that this protein is more similar to). Duplicates, where a protein was identified in multiple searches, were removed with the highest ranking (in &#x02018;result&#x02019; terms) kept, and the number of times it was identified recorded in a new column (&#x02018;repeats&#x02019;). The results were the ordered with the lowest &#x02018;Result number&#x02019; and the highest &#x02018;Probability&#x02019; to give a final list of proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data SD2-data">Figure 1&#x02014;source data 1, 2</xref>). Generally only proteins with a &#x02018;Result number&#x02019; &#x0003c;10, &#x02018;Probability&#x02019; &#x0003e;50%, at least 100 amino acids of homology (&#x02018;thstt&#x02019; to &#x02018;thend&#x02019;), and &#x02018;Repeats&#x02019; at least two times were considered to be real hits. For ease of visualisation, only proteins with Result number &#x0003c;10 or &#x02018;Repeats&#x02019; &#x0003e;2 are shown, and other proteins of interest (e.g., FCHo1, Syp1) with Result number &#x0003c;10 that did not fit the criteria listed above are greyed out. The &#x02018;IDs&#x02019; have been deduced using NCBI BLAST searches, and have not been experimentally verified.

In addition, the TSPOON promoter and the first 105 bases of the CDS were amplified from Ax2 gemonic DNA by PCR, using primers (5&#x02032;TATCTCGAGCGTCTTCATCTTCACTATCATTTAATG-3&#x02032;) and (5&#x02032;-TAAAAGCTTTTCATATTCACTCTGTTTCTCGTC-3&#x02032;). The product was cut with XhoI/HindIII, and the 536-bp fragment cloned into the pBluescript KSII plasmid already containing the TSPOON CDS, via the XhoI site in the vector and the silent HindIII site introduced at nucleotide +97 of the TSPOON CDS during its synthesis. The resulting promoter-driven TSPOON CDS was removed by digestion with XhoI/SpeI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pDM323 and pDM450, resulting in expression constructs containing the TSPOON CDS with GFP fused at its C terminus and driven by its own promoter (pDT61 and pDT58 respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title><italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cell culture and transformation</title><p>All of the methods used for cell biological studies on Dictyostelium are described in detail at Bio-protocol (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hirst et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p><italic>D. discoideum</italic> Ax2-derived strains were grown and maintained in HL5 medium (Formedium) containing 200 &#x000b5;g/ml dihydrostreptomycin on tissue culture treated plastic dishes, or shaken at 180 rpm, at 22&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Kay, 1987</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript describes the characterization of new heterohexameric complex (TSET) from the slime mold <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, with striking similarity to the AP and F-COPI adaptor complexes. Only using a clever 'reverse HHpred' strategy did the authors find the complex, since its sequence conservation is too weak for identification using more classical methods (Blast or the like). After biochemically characterizing the complex the authors go on with an in-depth phylogenetic analysis, which makes the clearest case yet that all APs, F-COPI, and TSET likely diverged from a common ancestor already present in LECA. This is a significant advance in our understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic life in general, and vesicle-mediated trafficking within the endomembrane system in particular. Importantly, this study also corrects the highly visible recently published misconception of a plant-specific adaptor complex (Gadeyne et al., Cell 2014).</p><p>Neither of the reviewers had major concerns and both strongly recommended publication. The conclusions are based on rigorous experimental procedures and skilled phylogenetic and bioinformatic analysis. However, one of the reviewers raised two minor points that you should consider in the revised manuscript:</p><p>1) The authors describe the 'reverse HHpred' method as novel; however, it appears to be conceptually very similar to the BackPhyre procedure, except that other proteomes are searched (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/help.cgi?id=help/backphyre">http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/help.cgi?id=help/backphyre</ext-link>). The authors are encouraged to reword the relevant text passages about the 'novelty' of reverse HHpred accordingly or, better, compare and contrast with BackPhyre.</p><p>2) The protocoatomer hypothesis as originally stated in <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Devos et al., 2004</xref> posited that the NPC and vesicle coats are related because of the use of proteins with common architecture in all systems. Ten years later, with an enormous amount of new data, we know that the story is not quite so simple. The beta-propeller is one of the most common folds in eukaryotes, and alpha-solenoids are also found in many processes, often to generate large protein assemblies. It is still an open question to what extend these different coating systems have a common origin, since the assembly of the only very superficially similar 'protocoatomer' structures are drastically different in clathrin COPI, COPII, and the NPC. To support the main thrust of this paper, we think that invoking the overly simplistic protocoatomer hypothesis is rather misleading, thus we would suggest to take it out or only refer to it in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="SA2" article-type="reply"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02866.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors describe the 'reverse HHpred' method as novel; however, it appears to be conceptually very similar to the BackPhyre procedure, except that other proteomes are searched (</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/help.cgi?id=help/backphyre">http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/help.cgi?id=help/backphyre</ext-link><italic>). The authors are encouraged to reword the relevant text passages about the 'novelty' of reverse HHpred accordingly or, better, compare and contrast with BackPhyre</italic>.</p><p>One of the reviewers pointed out that our reverse HHpred tool is conceptually similar to BackPhyre. We hadn&#x02019;t known about BackPhyre, so thank you for bringing it to our attention. We have now taken out the word &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; when referring to our tool, both in the Introduction and in the Conclusions; and in the Materials and methods section, we now compare and contrast reverse HHpred and BackPhyre. Interestingly, like reverse HHpred, BackPhyre was able to find three of the four core TSET subunits in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and in both cases the subunit that couldn&#x02019;t be found was TSAUCER. However, because reverse HHpred contains sequences from many more eukaryotes than BackPhyre, were able to find TSAUCER in both <italic>Naegleria</italic> and <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, neither of which is represented in BackPhyre. So without HHpred, we would never have been able to identify the entire heterotetramer bioinformatically. Because the BackPhyre website encourages users to submit requests for additional genomes to be added, eventually it may be possible to use reverse HHpred and BackPhyre as complementary tools for searching the entire diversity of eukaryotes.</p><p><italic>2) The protocoatomer hypothesis as originally stated in</italic>

<italic>posited that the NPC and vesicle coats are related because of the use of proteins with common architecture in all systems. Ten years later, with an enormous amount of new data, we know that the story is not quite so simple. The beta-propeller is one of the most common folds in eukaryotes, and alpha-solenoids are also found in many processes, often to generate large protein assemblies. It is still an open question to what extend these different coating systems have a common origin, since the assembly of the only very superficially similar 'protocoatomer' structures are drastically different in clathrin COPI, COPII, and the NPC. To support the main thrust of this paper, we think that invoking the overly simplistic protocoatomer hypothesis is rather misleading, thus we would suggest to take it out or only refer to it in the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>The same reviewer made the point that the 10-year-old protocoatomer hypothesis, which we refer to several times in our original manuscript, is an oversimplification, because lots of proteins that are not vesicle coats also have the &#x003b2;-propeller and &#x003b1;-solenoid architecture. Thus, we have removed all mention of protocoatomers per se, while still pointing out that this type of architecture is commonly used when building the scaffolding part of a coat, and still citing the Devos et al. paper that first made this point. We do suspect that at least some of the coat scaffolds have a common origin. For instance, an HHpred analysis of Sec31 pulls out &#x003b2;&#x02019;-COP immediately after Sec31 itself, although the relationship between clathrin heavy chain, Sec31, and COPI appears to be more distant. An in-depth phylogenetic analysis should shed more light on the evolution of these proteins, but for the time being, we agree that it is best to use the word &#x0201c;scaffold&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;protocoatomer&#x0201d;.</p><p>In addition to the changes described above, we have added some new TIRF microscopy data showing <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> expressing TSPOON-GFP. The original version of our manuscript contained only widefield data, which showed a diffuse cytosolic distribution of GFP-tagged TSPOON (which we know is overexpressed). However, by TIRF microscopy, we see discrete puncta, especially in the lower-expressing cells. This provides further evidence for TSPOON acting at the plasma membrane in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> as well as in plants.</p><p>We have also changed the title, from &#x0201c;TSET: an ancient and widespread trafficking complex&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;TSET: an ancient and widespread membrane trafficking complex&#x0201d; because one of our colleagues pointed out that for those not in the membrane traffic field, it wouldn&#x02019;t be clear from the title or abstract what the paper was going to be about.</p></body></sub-article></article>
